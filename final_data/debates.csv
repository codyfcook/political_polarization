2016-02-13 00:00:00,trump," Well I can say this. If the president and if I were president now I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice. I'm sure that frankly I'm absolutely sure that President Obama will try and do it. I hope that our Senate is going to be able Mitch and the entire group is going to be able to do something about it. In times of delay we could have a Diane Sykes or you could have a Bill Pryor we have some fantastic people. But this is a tremendous blow to conservatism. It's a tremendous blow frankly to our country. ... I think he's going to do it whether or I'm O.K. with it or not. I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it. It's called delay delay delay. What we want to do when we want to do it and how hard do we want to hit? Because we are going to have to hit very very hard to knock out ISIS. We're going to also have to learn who our allies are. We have allies so-called allies we're spending billions and billions of dollars supporting people we have no idea who they are in Syria. Do we want to stay that route or do we want to go and make something with Russia?I hate to say Iran but with Russia because we and the Iran deal is one of the worst deals I have ever seen negotiated in my entire life. It's a disgrace that this country negotiated that deal. But very important... Not only a disgrace it's a disgrace and an embarrassment. But very important who are we fighting with? Who are we fighting for? What are we doing? We have to rebuild our country. But we have to I'm the only one on this stage that said: ""Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq."" Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn't a politician fortunately.But I said it and I said it loud and clear ""You'll destabilize the Middle East."" That's exactly what happened.I also said by the way four years ago three years ago attack the oil take the wealth away attack the oil and keep the oil. They didn't listen. They just started that a few months ago. ... called me a genius I like him so far I have to tell you. Let me just tell you this. Jeb is so wrong. Jeb is absolutely self just so you understand you know what that is? That's Jeb's special interest and lobbyist talking.Look let me just tell you something Jeb Jeb is so wrong. You got to fight ISIS first. You fight ISIS first. Right now you have Russia you have Iran you have them with Assad and you have them with Syria. You have to knock out ISIS. They're chopping off heads. These are animals. You have to knock 'em out. You have to knock them off strong. You decide what to do after you can't fight two wars at one time.If you listen to him and you listen to some of the folks that I've been listening to that's why we've been in the Middle East for 15 years and we haven't won anything. We've spent $5 trillion dollars in the Middle East with thinking like that. We've spent $5... ...Lindsey Graham who backs him had zero on his polls. Let me just say something we've spent we've spent.I only tell the truth lobbyists.We've spent $5 trillion dollars all over the we have to rebuild our country. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. You listen to that you're going to be there for another 15... ... You'll end up with World War III... ... We're supporting troops... ... that we don't even know who they are. ... We're supporting troops that we don't even know who they are... We have no idea who they are. ... Oh yeah yeah... ... Let 44 million in New Hampshire it was practically ... ... 44 million give me a break. First of all I have to say as a businessman I get along with everybody. I have business all over the world. I know so many of the people in the audience. And by the way I'm a self-funder. I don't have I have my wife and I have my son. That's all I have. I don't have this. So let me just tell you I get along with everybody which is my obligation to my company to myself et cetera.Obviously the war in Iraq was a big fat mistake. All right? Now you can take it any way you want and it took it took Jeb Bush if you remember at the beginning of his announcement when he announced for president it took him five days.He went back it was a mistake it wasn't a mistake. It took him five days before his people told him what to say and he ultimately said ""It was a mistake."" The war in Iraq we spent $2 trillion thousands of lives we don't even have it. Iran has taken over Iraq with the second-largest oil reserves in the world.Obviously it was a mistake. George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East. You do whatever you want. You call it whatever you want. I want to tell you. They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction. I'm being nice. He spent $22 million in... The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign remember that. That's not keeping us safe. She should be running. How did he keep us safe when the World Trade Center the World excuse me. I lost hundreds of friends. The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe? That is not safe. That is not safe Marco. That is not safe. And George Bush by the way George Bush had the chance also and he didn't listen to the advice of his C.I.A. I don't want to go. Yes. First of all the when you say I'm the only candidate if you listen to the Democrats they want to do many things to Social Security and I want to do them on its own merit. You listen to them what they want to do to Social Security none of these folks are getting elected O.K. whether they can do it or not. I'm going to save Social Security. I'm going to bring jobs back from China. I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico and from Japan where they're all every country throughout the world now Vietnam that's the new one. They are taking our jobs. They are taking our wealth. They are taking our base. And you and I have had this discussion. We're going to make our economy strong again. I'm lowering taxes. We have $2.5 trillion offshore. We have 2.5 trillion that I think is actually five trillion because the government has no idea when they say 2.5 they have no idea what they're doing or saying as they've proven very well.We're going to bring that money back. You take a look at what happened just this week. China bought the Chicago Stock Exchange China a Chinese company. Carrier is moving to Mexico air conditioning company. Not only the ones I talk about all the time Nabisco and Ford and they're all moving out.We have an economy that last quarter G.D.P. didn't grow. It was flat. We have to make our economy grow again. We're dying. This country is dying. And our workers are losing their jobs and you're going... I'm the only one who is going to save Social Security believe me. Because you have tremendous waste. I'll tell you... You have tremendous waste fraud and abuse. That we're taking care of. That we're taking care of. It's tremendous. We have in Social Security right now thousands and thousands of people that are over 106 years old. Now you know they don't exist. They don't exist. There's tremendous waste fraud and abuse and we're going to get it. But we're not going to hurt the people who have been paying into Social Security their whole life and then all of a sudden they're supposed to get less. We're bringing our jobs back. We're going to make our economy great again. I want everybody taken care of but we have to take care of our people in this country. We're not taking care of our people. We have no border. We have no control. People are flooding across. We can't have it. We either have a border and I'm very strongly I'm not proposing. I will build a wall. I will build a wall. Remember this the wall will be paid for by Mexico. We are not being treated right. We are not being treated properly. If we don't have borders if we don't have strength we don't have a country. People are flowing across. We have to take care of our people. Believe me. Look... ...When I announced that I was running for president on June 16th illegal immigration wasn't even a subject. If I didn't bring it up we wouldn't even be talking. Now I don't often agree with Marco and I don't often agree with Ted but I can in this case. The weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration is Jeb Bush. They come out of an act of love whether you like it or not. He is so weak on illegal immigration it's laughable and everybody knows it. ... Spend a little more money on the commercials... . I don't know what you're talking about. ... I never called him I don't call him.. He also said about language... ... Language. Two days ago he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody and that's fine. Nobody reports that. He gets up and says that and then he tells me oh my language was a little bit rough... ... My language. Give me a break... ... You did say it you did say it. Been reported in 10 different news... Or a tax. I would build consensus with Congress and Congress would agree with me. I'll give you an example because I don't like the idea of using executive orders like our president. It is a disaster what he's doing. I would build consensus but consensus means you have to work hard. You have to cajole. You have to get them into the Oval Office and get them all together and you have to make deals. Let me just tell you I mentioned before China big Chinese company bought the Chicago Exchange. Kerry is moving and if you saw the people because they have a video of the announcement that Carrier is moving to Mexico O.K.?Well I'll tell you what. I would go right now to Carrier and I would say I am going to work awfully hard. You're going to make air conditioners now in Mexico. You're going to get all of these 1400 people that are being laid off they're laid off. They were crying. They were it was a very sad situation. You're going to go to Mexico. You're going to make air conditioners in Mexico you're going to put them across our border with no tax.I'm going to tell them right now I am going to get consensus from Congress and we're going to tax you when those air conditioners come. So stay where you are or build in the United States because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers. John in life you have flexibility. You do have flexibility. When you're fighting wars you're going one way you have a plan. It's a beautiful plan. It can't lose. The enemy makes a change and all of a sudden you have to change. You have to have flexibility. In Ronald Reagan though in terms of what we're talking about was the great example. He was a somewhat liberal Democrat who became a somewhat pretty strong conservative. He became most importantly he became a great president. He made many of the changes that I've made I mean I've seen as I grew up I've seen and as I get older and wiser and I feel that I am a conservative.Now I also feel I'm a common-sense conservative because some of the views I don't agree with. And I think a lot of people agree with me obviously based on what's happening. Well I think these people always hit me with eminent domain and frankly I'm not in love with eminent domain. But eminent domain is something you need very strongly. When Jeb had said ""You used eminent domain privately for a parking lot."" It wasn't for a parking lot. The state of New Jersey too bad Chris Christie is not here he could tell you the state of New Jersey went to build a very large tower that was going to employ thousands of people.I mean it was going to really do a big job in terms of economic development. Now just so you understand I got hit very hard. It's private it's private eminent domain. You understand that they took over a stadium in Texas and they used private eminent domain but he just found that out after he made the charge. Yeah. Well Jeb wouldn't have known about it. You shouldn't have used it then Jeb. Thank you very much I appreciate it. You probably are worse than Jeb Bush. You are single biggest liar. This guy's lied let me just tell you this guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa and he just continues. Today we had robo-calls saying ""Donald Trump is not going to run in South Carolina"" where I'm leading by a lot. I'm not going to vote for Ted Cruz. This is the same thing he did to Ben Carson. This guy will say anything nasty guy. Now I know why he doesn't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues. He's a nasty guy. Where did I support it? Where did I... Again where did I support it? Hey Ted where I support it? Where did I support? That's a lot of lies. It does do wonderful things but not as it relates to abortion. Excuse me. Excuse me there are wonderful things having to do with women's health. But not when it comes to abortion. Hold on... Ted Cruz told your brother that he wanted John Roberts to be on the United States Supreme Court. They both pushed him he twice approved Obamacare. O.K. governor. You pushed him. You pushed him. You worked with him and you pushed him. Why do you lie? Why do you lie? You pushed him. Yeah yeah I know you're an adult. Well I would say my wife tells me I'm wrong all the time. And I listen. Oh let me just say look I am very open I hired top people. I've had great success. I built a great great company. I don't need to do this. I'm self-funding. I'm spending a lot of money. I've spent like in New Hampshire I spent $3 million. Jeb bush spent $44 million. He came in five and I came in No. 1. That's what the country needs folks. I spent 3 he spends 42 of their money of special interest money. And it's just this is not going to make excuse me. This is not going to make our country great again.This is not what we need in our country. We need people that know what the hell they're doing. And politicians they're all talk they're no action. And that's why people are supporting me.I do listen to people. I hire experts. I hire top top people. And I do listen. And you know what? Sometimes they're wrong. You have to know what to do when to do it. But sometimes they're wrong. Well I'll tell you over the years I've made many speeches. People have asked me big companies have asked me to make speeches and friends of mine that run big companies on success. And occasion in order to sort of really highlight something I'll use a profanity. One of the profanities that I got credited with using that I didn't use was a very bad word two weeks ago that I never used.I said ""You."" And everybody said ""Oh he didn't say anything wrong."" But you bleeped it so everyone thinks I said the I didn't say anything. I never said the word.It is very unfair that criticism. Now I will say this with all of that being said I have said I will not do it at all because if I say a word that's a little bit off color a little bit it ends up being a headline.I will not do it again. I was a very good student at a great school not using by the way not using profanity is very easy. That's not let me respond. That's another lie. I never went bankrupt! No but it's another lie. No but it's another lie. This guy doesn't know what he's talking about. Just a lie. Let me just tell you. Jeb goes around saying just like the biggest business leaders in this country I've used the laws of the land to chapter I bought a company I threw it immediately into a chapter I made a great deal. I uses the laws to my benefit because I run a company. Excuse me Jeb! I never went bankrupt never. Now but you don't want to say that. Now let me just say I've used it just like the biggest leaders in the country. Let me tell you something Florida. Florida he put so much debt on Florida. You know we keep saying he's a wonderful governor wonderful governor. He put so much debt on Florida and he increased spending so much that as soon as he got out of office Florida crashed.I happened to be there. It's my second home. Florida crashed. He didn't do a good job as governor. And you haven't excuse me you haven't heard that. You listen to the good record in Florida. You take a look at what happened as soon as that year ended he got out Florida crashed. Too much debt. He loaded it up with debt and his spending went through the roof. By the way... ... he was not a good governor. Take a look at your numbers. Florida went down the tubes right after he got out of office. Went right down because of what he did to it. Thank you. Politicians are all talk no action. You've seen where they've take you to. We are 19 trillion dollars right now. It's going to be increased with that horrible budget from a month ago that was just approved by politicians.We need a change. We need a very big change. We're going to make our country great again.I say this every night every day every afternoon and it's so true we don't win anymore. We don't win with health care we don't win with ISIS and the military we don't take care of our vets we don't care of our borders we don't win. We are going to start winning again. We are not going to be controlled by people that are special interests and lobbyists that everybody here has contributed to. And you know what they do exactly what those folks want them to do.We are going to make our country great and we're going to do the right thing. I'm working for you. I'm not working for anybody else.Thank you very much."
2016-02-13 00:00:00,garrett," Senator Cruz. John mentioned this is about dollars and incentives. We also want to talk about economic growth engagements. You have proposed a consumption tax you called it the ""back tax."" Some analysts compare it more to an attributed ""value-added tax.""From the perspective from economic growth in building wages how does that work and how would you address those longstanding conservative concerns that something approaching the ""value-added tax"" would be used to constantly increase those rates to pay for future government spending and become an escalator of taxation not of growth? Now the question conservatives have sort of this idea conceptually for a long time but especially on this consumption value-added tax system. In Europe where it exists it has become an escalator of taxation to feed government spending and that's why conservatives have long resisted it. Why and what would you do as president to make sure that doesn't happen? Governor Bush a question for you but if you want to jump in please. Jump in and then I've got a question for you. Real quickly jump in because I have got a question for Governor Bush but jump in. Understood Governor Kasich. Yeah Governor Bush fine. Let me get in a question from... I understand I understand. I have a question on economic growth Governor Bush. A  Governor. I know understood. Governor Bush. Governor Bush from the perspective economic growth viewed from this perspective of economic growth you have proposed a tax on hedge fund managers. The Americans for Tax Reform a conservative tax group you're probably aware of has said no Republican should be for higher taxes on capital gains. And many conservatives wonder if this proposal of yours would undermine not only that philosophy but undercut your projection of 4 percent economic growth annually under your presidency? ... Dr. Carson... Senator Rubio... For the purposes of the lines lines you would draw legislatively as a president on immigration reform define amnesty. Very quickly Senator Cruz. Governor Bush I want to bring this out to a little wider philosophical aspect if you will. You have said illegal immigrants quote ""broke the law but it's not a felony"" still quoting you ""it's an act of love it's an act of commitment to your family."" Mr. Trump has as you are well aware denounced that statement over and over. Do you still believe it? What does that mean to you? And how does that inform your approach to immigration reform? Fundamentally do you believe this rhetoric is insufficiently compassionate to this issue? Mr. Trump... ... Governor Kasich here in South Carolina earlier this week you said the idea the concept of deporting 11 million undocumented workers... ... We will leave the moon metaphors to be adjudicated later I assure you. Governor Kasich you said earlier this week in South Carolina the concept the idea of deporting 11 million undocumented workers in this country is nuts. Why is it you are so opposed to that idea? Senator Cruz has said it's a simple application of existing law. The application of that is not inhumane it is just. Why do you disagree? ... What are you for on immigration? Mr. Trump Mr. Trump. I was with you in Pendleton South Carolina earlier this week at the Rodeo Arena. It was a bit chilly there. You promised the crowd and they rose to their feet that if Ford or a company like were to move a factory to Mexico you would try to stop it or threaten them with a 35 percent tax or tariff on every car sold. Right. So my question is based on your understanding of the presidency where do you derive that power? Would you need the consent of Congress to go along? And do you see the presidency as a perch from which you can cajole and/or threaten private industry to do something you think is better for the U.S. economy? Thank you governor."
2016-02-13 00:00:00,rubio," Well let me first talk about Justice Scalia. His loss is tremendous and obviously our hearts and prayers go out to his family. He will go down as one of the great justices in the history of this republic. You talk about someone who defended consistently the original meaning of the Constitution who understood that the Constitution was not there to be interpreted based on the fads of the moment but it was there to be interpreted according to its original meaning.Justice Scalia understood that better than anyone in the history of this republic. His dissent for example on the independent counsel case is a brilliant piece of jurist work. And of course his dissent on Obergefell as well.No. 2 I do not believe the president should appoint someone. And it's not unprecedented. In fact it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice.And it remind us of this how important this election is. Someone on this stage will get to choose the balance of the Supreme Court and it will begin by filling this vacancy that's there now.And we need to put people on the bench that understand that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document. It is to be interpreted as originally meant. That's not accurate. No I've never there has been for example today according to the changes Harry Reid made appellate judges can now be appointed by a simple majority but not Supreme Court justices. And I think today you see the wisdom of why we don't want that to change. Because if that were the case and we were not in charge of the Senate Harry Reid and Barack Obama would ram down our throat a liberal justice like the ones Barack Obama has imposed on us already. No. I think there are three major threats that you want to immediately get on top of. No. 1 is what are we doing in the Asia-Pacific region where both North Korea and China pose threats to the national security of the United States. No. 2 is what are we doing in the Middle East with the combination of the Sunni-Shia conflict driven by the Shia arc that Iran is now trying to establish in the Middle East also the growing threat of ISIS.And the third is rebuilding and reinvigorating NATO in the European theater particularly in Central Europe and in Eastern Europe where Vladimir Putin is now threatening the territory of multiple countries already controls 20 percent of Georgia and a significant percentage of Ukraine. Well let me tell you what has happened a couple of years ago. One of the hardest decisions you'll ever make in Congress is when you are asked by the president to authorize the use of force in a conflict because you are now putting your name on behalf of the people of your state behind a military action where Americans in uniform could lose their life. So in 2014 Barack Obama said he would not take military action against Assad unless it was authorized by the Senate beginning on the Committee of Foreign Relations where I am one of its members. And it was hard because you looked at the pictures. I saw the same images people saw. I'm the father of children. I saw the images of these little children been gassed and poisoned by their own leaders and we were angry. Something had to happen and there was the sense that we needed to seek retribution.And then I looked at Barack Obama's plan. Barack Obama's plan which John Kerry later described as unbelievably small and I concluded that that attack would not only not help the situation it would make it actually worse. It would allow Assad to stand up to the United States of America survive a strike stay in power and actually strengthen his grip.So it was a difficult decision to make and when we only had a few days to look at and make a decision on it and I voted against Barack Obama's plan to use force and it was the right decision. I just want to say at least on behalf of me and my family I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore. And you can I think you can look back in hindsight and say a couple of things but he kept us safe. And not only did he keep us safe but no matter what you want to say about weapons of mass destruction Saddam Hussein was in violation of U.N. resolutions in open violation and the world wouldn't do anything about it and George W. Bush enforced what the international community refused to do.And again he kept us safe and I am forever grateful to what he did for this country. The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didn't kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him. Well because I'm influencing social policy this is their money. This is the money of parents. You don't earn the tax credit unless you're working. That's your money it doesn't belong to government. Here's what I don't understand. If a business takes their money and they invest in the piece of the equipment they get to write off their taxes. But if a parent takes money that they have earned to work and invests in their children they don't? This makes no sense.Parenting is the most important job any of us will ever have. Family formation is the most important thing in society. So what my tax plan does is it does create especially for working families an additional Child Tax Credit. So that parents who are working get to keep more of their own money not the government's money to invest in their children to go to school to go to a private school to buy a new backpack.Let me tell you if you're a parent that's struggling then you know that $50 a month is the difference between a new pair of shoes this month or not getting a new pair of shoes for your kids. I'm going to have a tax plan that is pro-family because the family is the most important institution in society. You cannot have a strong country without strong families. Well first of all I think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that I've never supported that. I do not support that. I think there has to be consequences for violating our immigration laws. What I think is clear about this issue to begin with is we're not going to be able to make progress on illegal immigration until first illegal immigration is brought under control. You go back to 1986 when they legalized three million people and they promised to secure the border. It didn't happen and as a result people have lost trust in the federal government. It is now clear that the only way to make progress on immigration is not just to pass a law that enforces the law but actually prove to people that it's working.They want to see the wall built. They want to see the additional border agents. They want to see E-Verify. They want to see an entry-exit tracking system. Forty percent of the people in this country illegally are entering legally and overstaying visas. And only after all of that is in place then we'll see what the American people are willing to support on this issue.I think the American people will be very reasonable but responsible about how you handle someone who has been here a long time who can pass a background check who pays a fine and starts paying taxes and all they want is a work permit. But you can't do any of that until you prove to people that illegal immigration is under control once and for all. We're going to have to do this again O.K.? When that issue was being debated Ted Cruz at a committee hearing very passionately said I want immigration reform to pass I want people to be able to come out of the shadows. And he proposed an amendment that would legalized people here. Not only that he proposed doubling the number of green cards. He proposed a 500 percent increase on guest workers. Now his position is different. Now he is a passionate opponent of all those things.So he either wasn't telling the truth then or he isn't telling the truth now but to argue he is a purist on immigration is just not true. Well first of all I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish. And second of all the other point that I would make... Look this is a disturbing pattern now because for a number of weeks now Ted Cruz has just been telling lies. He lied about Ben Carson in Iowa. He lies about Planned Parenthood. He lies about marriage. He's lying about all sorts of things. And now he makes things up. The bottom line is this is a campaign and people are watching it. And they see the truth behind all these issues.And here is the truth Ted Cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country... ... and only now does he say... Well we'll put on our website marcorubio.com. We're going to... On anything I want? Well let me talk about poverty. I do. I had something important. The issue of poverty is critical because for me poverty is the is is free enterprise not reaching people. Today we have antipoverty programs that don't cure poverty. We don't cure poverty in America. Our antipoverty programs have become in some instances a way of life a lifestyle. Now we do need antipoverty programs you can't have free enterprise programs without them but not as a way of life. And so I have a very specific proposal on this and I don't in 60 seconds I can't describe it all but it basically turns the program over to states. It allows states to design innovative programs that cure poverty because I think Nikki Haley will do a better job curing poverty than Barack Obama. Well no. It's not the case. It didn't pass and we haven't solved immigration in this country. It's still a problem. It is worse today than it was three years ago which is worse than it was five years ago. And it has to be confronted and solved. But the only way forward on this issue you asked a question about flexibility. Let me tell you about that. One of the things that you need in leadership is the ability to understand that to get things done you must figure out the way to get it done. You will not pass comprehensive immigration reform. People do not trust the federal government.They want to see the law being enforced. They want to see illegal immigration come under control. They want to see that wall. They want to see E-Verify. They want to see all of these things working and then they will have a conversation with you about what do you do with people that have been here a long time that are otherwise you know not criminals. But they're not going to do it until you first enforce the law. Thirty seconds. I speak fast. Well I think one of the presidents well the president I grew up under was Ronald Reagan. And Reagan had a vision for America's future. And if you think about what Ronald Reagan inherited it's not unlike what the next president is going to inherit. This is the worst president we've had in 35 years 35 years back would have made it Jimmy Carter. That's what Ronald Reagan inherited. And I think the question you would ask is how did you inspire again the American people to believe in the future?How did you what did it take to ensure that the American people despite all of the difficulties of the time you know you look back at that time the American military was in decline. Our standing in the world was in decline. We had hostages being held in Iran. Our economy was in bad shape.The American people were scared about the future. They were scared about what kind of country their children were going to live in and inherit. And yet somehow Ronald Reagan was able to instill in our nation and in our people a sense of optimism.And he turned America around because of that vision and ultimately because of that leadership. I wish Ronald Reagan was still around. This country needs someone just like that.And if our next president is even half the president Ronald Reagan was America is going to be greater than it has ever been. Thank you and thank you for watching tonight. This is a difficult time in our country. Our economy's flat it's not creating the jobs it once did and people struggle living paycheck to paycheck. Our culture's in trouble. Wrong is considered right and right is considered wrong.All the things that once held our families together are now under constant assault. And around the world America's reputation is in decline. Our allies don't trust us our adversaries don't fear us Iran captures our sailors and parades them before the world on video.These are difficult times but 2016 can be a turning point. That's why I'm running for president and that's why I'm here today to ask you for your vote. If you elect me president we are going to re-embrace free enterprise so that everyone can go as far as their talent and their work will take them.We are going to be a country that says that ""life begins at conception and life is worthy of the protection of our laws."" We're going to be a country that says ""that marriage is between one man and one woman."" We are going to be a country that says ""The constitution and the rights that it talks about do not come from our president they come from our creator."" We are going to be loyal to our allies like Israel not enemies like Iran. And we will rebuild the U.S. military so no one will there test it.Vote for me. I will unify this party. I will grow it. We will win this election and we will make the 21st century a new American century."
2016-02-13 00:00:00,carson," Well the current Constitution actually doesn't address that particular situation but the fact of the matter is the Supreme Court obviously is a very important part of our governmental system. And when our Constitution was put in place the average age of death was under 50 and therefore the whole concept of lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges and federal judges was not considered to be a big deal. Obviously that has changed and it's something that probably needs to be looked at pretty carefully at some point. But we need to start thinking about the divisiveness that is going on in our country. I looked at some of the remarks that people made after finding out that Justice Scalia had died and they were truly nasty remarks. And that we have managed to get to that position in our country is truly a shame. And we should be thinking about how we could create some healing in this land.But right now we're not going to get healing with President Obama. That's very United Nations clear. So I... ... fully agree that we should not allow a judge to be appointed during his time. No it isn't. First of all let me go back to your first question for me. It wasn't phrased as who gets to nominate Supreme Court appointees. Of course that's the president. So I know that there are some left-wing media who would try to make hay on that. Secondly thank you for including me in the debate. Two questions already. This is great. Now as far... ...as far as those 2 a.m. phone calls are concerned judgment is what is required. And the kinds of things that you come up with are sometimes very very difficult and very unique. One of the things that I was known for is doing things that have not been done before. So no amount of experience really prepares you to do something that has never been done before. That's where judgment comes in.And that I think is a situation that we're in right now a situation that we have never been in before with the kinds of threats that pose real danger to our nation and it comes in very handy in those situations. Well first of all let me just address the Iraq question. You know I was not particularly in favor of us going to war in Iraq primarily because I have studied you know the Middle East recognizing that those are nations that are ruled by dictators and have been for thousands of years. And when you go in and you remove one of those dictators unless you have an appropriate plan for replacing them you're going to have chaos.Now fortunately we were able to stabilize the situation and it was the current administration that turned tail and ran and destabilized the situation. Now having said that in terms of the rules of engagement I was talking about you know Obama has said you know we shouldn't bomb tankers you know coming out of refineries because there may be people in there or because the environment may be hurt.You know that's just asinine thinking. And the fact of the matter is... You know we obviously you're not going to accomplish all of your goals without some collateral damage. You have to be able to assess what is acceptable and what is not. Well first of all let me just mention on the tax issue. Bencarson.com go read about it because my tax plan has been praised by Cato by Wall Street Journal. Forbes said it is the best the most pro-growth tax plan and it's based on real fairness for everybody. Starts at the 150 percent poverty level but even the people below that have to pay something because everybody has to have skin in the game and the millions of people can't you know talk about what other people have to pay and have no skin in the game. And it deals with corporate tax rate and makes it the same as everybody else... ...everybody pays exactly the same. ... And as far as Medicare and Medicaid my main goal is to get rid of Obamacare and put the care back in the hands of ... Well first of all please go to my website bencarson.com and read my immigration policy O.K.? Because it actually makes sense. Now the as far as these fines are concerned you know? Here's the big problem. We've got all these government regulators and all they're doing is running around looking for people to fine. And we've got 645 different federal agencies and sub-agencies. Way way too many and they don't have anything else to do.I think what we really need to do is start trimming the regulatory agencies rather than going after the people who are trying to increase the viability economic viability of our society. Now that doesn't mean there aren't some people out there who are doing bad things. But I'm not sure that the way to solve that problem is by increasing all the regulatory burden. You know when you consider how much regulations cost us each year you know? $2 trillion dollars per family $24000 per family that happens to be the same level as the poverty level... ... for a family of four. If you want to get rid of poverty get rid of all the regulations. Before you ask the question can I respond to the you know they mentioned my name a couple of times. All right. Well first of all you know so many people have said to me ""You need to scream and jump and down jump up and down like everybody else."" Is that really what you want? What we just saw? I don't think so. And you know I when I got into this race I decided to look under the hood of the engine of what runs Washington D.C. and my first inclination was to run away but I didn't do it because I'm thinking about our children and the fact that we are the United States of America. And anybody up here is going to be much better than what's going to come on the other side. And what happened tonight with with Justice Scalia tells you that we cannot afford to lose this election and we cannot be tearing each other down. Well first of all I'm not a politician so I'm never going to become a politician. But here's what here's what people need to know. People need to know that free college is not it's a non-starter. You know you have to look at our economic situation. We're on the verge of economic collapse and you know we're it's not just the $19 trillion but it's also the $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities. What we need to think about is what does that do to the average person? When we have a debt of that nature it causes the Fed to change their policy it causes the central bank to keep the the rates low and who does does that affect? Mr. Average who used to go to the bank every Friday and put part of his check in the bank and watch it grow over three decades and be able to retire with a nice nest egg that's gone. That part of the American dream is gone.All of these things are disappearing and Bernie Sanders and people like Hillary Clinton blame it on the rich. They say those evil rich people if we take their money we can solve the problem. It's not the evil rich people. It's the irresponsible evil government. This is the first generation not expected to do better than their parents. Some people say it's the new normal but there's nothing normal about it in an exceptional American. I like you am a member of we the people and we know that our country is heading off the cliff. Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you have to undermine three things: our spiritual life our patriotism and our morality. We the people can stop that decline starting right here in South Carolina. If all the people who say ""I love Ben Carson and his policies but he can't win"" vote for me not only can we win but we can turn this thing around.You know we have this manipulation by the political class and by the media telling us who we're supposed to pick and how we're supposed to live. We the people are the only people who will determine that. And if you elect me as your next president I promise you that you will get somebody who is accountable to everybody and beholden to no one. Thank you."
2016-02-13 00:00:00,bush, Right. Not on specific issues not at all. I think the next president if I'm president I will appoint people I'll nominate people that have a proven record in the judiciary. The problem in the past has been we have appointed people thinking you can get it through the Senate because they didn't have a record. And the problem is that sometimes we're surprised.The simple fact is the next president needs to appoint someone with a proven conservative record similar to Justice Scalia that is a lover of liberty that believes in limited government that consistently applied that kind of philosophy that didn't try to legislator from the bench that was respectful of the Constitution.And then fight and fight and fight for that nomination to make sure that that nomination passes.Of course the president by the way has every right to nominate Supreme Court justices. I'm an Article II guy in the Constitution. We're running for the president of the United States. We want a strong executive for sure. But in return for that there should be a consensus orientation on that nomination and there's no doubt in my mind that Barack Obama will not have a consensus pick when he submits that person to the Senate. Yes. No it doesn't and that's the problem. The lack of leadership in this country by Barack Obama John Kerry Hillary Clinton thinking that this is a policy that works this policy of containment with ISIS. It's a complete unmitigated disaster. And to allow Russia now to have influence in Syria makes it harder but we need to destroy ISIS and dispose of Assad to create a stable Syria so that the four million refugees aren't a breeding ground for Islamic jihadists. This is the problem. Donald Trump brought up the fact that he would he'd want to accommodate Russia. Russia is not taking out ISIS. They're they're attacking our our our team the team that we've been training and the team that we've been supporting. It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that Russia could be a positive partner in this. They are on the run. They are making every time we step back they're on the run. The question that you asked was a really good one about what you would do what three things would you do.I would restore the military the sequester needs to be reversed. I would have a strategy to destroy ISIS and I would immediately create a policy of containment as it relates to Iran's ambitions and to make it make clear that we are not going to allow for Iran to do what it's doing which is to move towards a nuclear weapon.Those three things would be the first and foremost things that we need to do... ... in 2017. The very basic fact is that Vladimir Putin is not going to be an ally of the United States. The whole world knows this. It's a simple basic fact. They're not taking out they're not even attempting to take out ISIS. They're attacking the troops that we're supporting. We need to create a coalition Sunni-led coalition on the ground with our special operators to destroy ISIS and bring about stability. And you can't do that with Assad in power. He has... ... Let me finish... ... This is ridiculous... ... This is coming from a guy who gets his foreign policy from the shows. ... This is a guy who thinks that Hillary Clinton is a great negotiator in Iran... ... This is a man who insults his way to the nomination... I think it's my turn isn't it? I've got about five or six... Do I get to do it five or six times or just once responding to that? So here's the deal. I'm sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he has had. And frankly I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me. It's blood sport for him. He enjoys it. And I'm glad he's happy about it. But I am sick and tired... I am sick and tired of him going after my family. My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind. And while Donald Trump was building a reality TV show my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And I'm proud of what he did. And he has had the gall to go after my brother. He has had the gall to go after my mother. Hold on. Let me finish. He has had the gall to go after my mother. Look I won the lottery when I was born 63 years ago looked up and I saw my mom. My mom is the strongest woman I know. This is not about my family or his family. This is about the South Carolina families that need someone to be a commander in chief that can lead. I'm that person. Can I just... I'm not going to invite Donald Trump to the rally in Charleston on Monday afternoon when my brother is coming to speak. I'm rescinding the invitation. I thought you might want to come but I guess not. I'd like can I can I... Look I admire the fact that Governor Kasich is supporting spending more money on drug treatment and mental health. I think that's a high priority all across this country but expanding Obamacare is what we're talking about and Obamacare's expansion even though the federal government is paying for the great majority of it is creating further debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren. We should be fighting Obamacare repealing Obamacare replacing it with something totally different. When I was as a private citizen Florida was confronted with the choice. The governor was supportive of doing what John did. So was the Florida Senate. A committed speaker of the House asked me to go as a private citizen to make the case against the expansion.I did and it wasn't expanded there just as it wasn't expanded in South Carolina under Governor Haley. South Carolina South Carolinians need to know this because the Cato Institute which grades governors based on their spending rank him right at the bottom. And Governor Haley is ranked at the top. No. He mentioned my name. Let me finish though. No no no hey wait wait wait. Just hold Major hold Major. Hold on Major. South Carolinians want to make that they elect the most conservative governor or candidate that can win. Of course not. It won't have an impact on hedge funds managers paying ordinary income. In fact it's not just hedge fund people but people that are doing they're in the business of investing other people's money getting capital gains treatment is not appropriate. They should be paying ordinary income. That's their business. They're grateful to be able to make a lot of money I'm sure. And what we do is lower the rates. It's not the end of the world that private equity people and hedge fund folks that are right now getting capital gains treatment for the income they earn pay ordinary income like everybody else in this room. That's not a problem at all. What we need to do is reform the tax code to simplify the rates to shift power away from Washington D.C. That's what I did as governor of the state of Florida $19 billion dollars of tax cuts and it stimulated seven out of the eight years. Florida led the nation in job growth. Thank you. Great question. I feel like I have to get into my inner Chris Christie and point out that the reason why I should be president is listening to two senators talk about arcane amendments to bills that didn't pass. This is this is the problem. We need a leader to fix this problem. And I have a detailed plan to do just that including controlling the border dealing with the visa over-stayers making sure that we have a path to legal status not to citizenship for those that come out from the shadows and pay a fine learn English don't commit crimes work and pay taxes.That is the better approach. The great majority of people that come to this country come because they have no other choice. They want to come to provide for their families. That doesn't mean it's right. That doesn't mean it's right. We should pick who comes to our country. We should control our border. Coming here legally should be a lot easier than coming here illegally. But the motivation they're not all rapists as you-know-who said. They're not that.These are people that are coming to provide for their families. And we should show a little more respect for the fact that they're struggling. It doesn't mean we shouldn't be controlling the border. That's exactly what we should be doing. ... So you know... ...This is the standard operating procedure to disparage me. That's fine... ... But if you want to talk about weakness you want to talk about weakness? It's weak to disparage women. It's weak to denigrate the disabled. Andit's really weak to call John McCain a loser because he was a... ... That is outrageous. The guy's an American hero. ... The simple fact is I've also laid out my plans on immigration... Just for the record make sure my mother's listening if she's watching the debate. I didn't say that I was going to moon somebody... So there so there is all sorts of intrigue about where I disagree with my brother there would be one right there. You should not use eminent domain for private purposes. A baseball stadium or a parking lot for a limo... It's very different. Transmission lines pipe lines bridges and highways. All of that is proper use of imminent domain. Not to take an elderly woman's home to build a parking lot so that high-rollers can come from New York City to build casinos in Atlantic City. My name was mentioned twice. He called me a liar. Also he talked about one of my heroes Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan was a liberal maybe in the 1950s. He was a conservative reformed governor for eight years before he became president and no one should suggest he made an evolution for political purposes. He was a conservative and he didn't tear down people like Donald Trump is. He tore down the Berlin Wall. He was a great guy. That was me. Yeah well I have got to respond to this. Sounds like a good plan. Or you could ask me two questions so I could get two minutes instead of one. I think the dysfunction in Washington is really dangerous that's what I think. And we need a proven leader that has a record of solving problems someone who doesn't cut and run; someone who could be a commander in chief to unite our country around common purposes; someone who doesn't disparage people. Someone that doesn't brag for example that he has been bankrupt four times and it was great because he could use the legal system.Someone... We need someone with a proven record to be able to forge consensus to solve problems. And right now both Republicans and Democrats in Washington don't get it. People are struggling 63 percent of Americans can't make a $500 car payment. Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. And we need someone has a proven record of growing the economy reforming the things that are broken.And I'm that person. Yeah... Yeah. Here we go. Here's the record. Here's the record. We led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years. When I left there was $9 billion of reserves 35 percent of general revenue. No state came close to that. When I during my time we were one of the two states to go to AAA bond rating. We didn't go bankrupt like Trump did and call it success when people are laid off when vendors don't get paid. That's not success. What we did was create an environment where people had a chance to have income. Personal income during my time went up by 4.4 percent. The government grew by... ... half of that. Thank you all very much. The next president is going to be confronted with an unforeseen challenge. That's almost certain. It could be a pandemic a major natural disaster or an attack on our country. The question for South Carolinians and Americans is who do you want to have sitting behind the big desk in the Oval Office? Because that's the question. It's not the things we're talking about today. It's the great challenge that may happen. I believe I will have a steady hand as commander in chief and president of the United States. I will unite this country around common purposes because I did it as governor of the state of Florida. When I was governor we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. Our state was on its back. We recovered far faster than what people thought because we led.We want to challenge rather than cutting and running. That's what we need in Washington D.C. We need someone with a servant's heart that has a backbone that isn't going to focus on polls and focus groups. The focus will be on the American people to keep them safe and secure.I ask for your vote next Saturday.
2016-02-13 00:00:00,strassel," Mr. Trump. You have made a lot of promises and you have also you're the only candidate who has said he would not touch entitlements. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that your ideas would cost an additional $12 trillion to $15 trillion over the next 10 years and that we would have to have annual economic growth of anywhere from 7.7 percent to 9 percent annually to pay for them. Are you proposing more than you can actually deliver at least not without big deficits? But in terms of... O.K. But how would you actually do that? Can I ask you? Because right now Social Security and Medicare... They take up two-thirds of the federal budget and they're growing. O.K. I have a question a related tax question. Senator Rubio you have the highest tax rate of anyone up on the stage in terms of the top tax rates 35 percent. Some economists say ""It would limit its potential to boost economic growth."" You do that so that you will have more revenue to pay for a tripling of the Child Tax Credit.Normally it's liberals who like to use the tax code to insert social policy. Why should conservatives who want to tax adopt the other side's approach? Governor Kasich this on is on size of government. In 2013 you pushed through a Medicaid reform in your state over the rejections of many of the Republicans in your state. Total enrollment and overall cost of program have gone well beyond what anyone had expected including yourself. How can you argue that this overall growth fits in with conservative ambition to significantly cut back on the size of federal welfare programs? Senator Cruz. Senator Cruz you have promised to deport illegal aliens. You have also promised to reverse President Obama's executive action that gives temporary amnesty to illegals brought here by their parent as children. As president you would have the names and addresses of the some 800000 of those that have registered under that action. Now you have said that in this country we shouldn't go door to door look for illegals but in this case you would have a list. Would you use it? So would you would you use the addresses? Would you pick them up? Senator Rubio your reply. All right. Senator Cruz. Your response Senator Cruz. ... O.K.... Moving subjects. Dr. Carson this week Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $3.2 billion fine to state and federal authorities for contributing to the mortgage crisis. You have a lot of Democrats out saying that we should be jailing more executives so two questions. Should financial executives be held legally responsible for financial crisis and do you think fines like these are an effective way to deter companies from future behavior like that? Senator Cruz you were mentioned in the mix here your response? And now Marco Rubio. We'll be back with a few final thoughts in a moment."
2016-02-13 00:00:00,kasich, Well John first of all if I were president we wouldn't have the divisions in the country we have today. I do want to take a second as we reflected on Judge Scalia it's amazing it's not even two minutes after the death of Judge Scalia nine children here today their father didn't wake up. His wife sad but I just wish we hadn't run so fast into politics. Here's my concern about this. The country is so divided right now and now we're going to see another partisan fight take place. I really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody. If you were to nominate somebody let's have him pick somebody that's going to have unanimous approval and such widespread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination. I don't think that's going to happen and I would like the president just to for once here put the country first. We're going to have an election for president very soon and the people will understand what is at stake in that election.And so I believe the president should not move forward and I think that we ought to let the next president of the United States decide who is going to run that Supreme Court with a vote by the people of the United... ...States of America. First of all yes. First of all look we have to make it clear to Russia what we expect. We don't have to declare an enemy rattle a sword or threaten but we need to make it clear what we expect. No. 1 is we will arm the folks in Ukraine who are fighting for their freedom. They deserve it. There will be no ifs ands or buts about it. Secondly an attack on NATO trumped up on any excuse of Russian-speaking people either in the NATO countries or in Finland or Sweden is going to be an attack on us. And look I think we have an opportunity as America to put something really great together again.The Egyptians the Saudis the Jordanians the Gulf states they all know they're at risk. We need to look into Europe we look at France we look at Germany and the migrants. We look at Belgium we look at Britain. Everybody now is being threatened by radical Islam. We have an opportunity to lead.You know the fact of the matter is the world is desperate for our leadership. Sometimes they may they may make a remark here or there that we don't like but frankly the world needs us. And we have an opportunity now to assemble a coalition of the civilized people those who respect civilization the rights of women the rights to protest to be able to reassert our leadership all across this globe again and make sure this century is going to be the best we've ever seen. I've got to tell you this is just crazy huh? This is just nuts O.K.? Jeez oh man. I'm sorry John. Oh well listen I think being in Iraq look we thought there were weapons of mass destruction. Colin Powell who is one of the most distinguished generals in modern time said there were weapons there. But but the fact is we got ourselves in the middle of a civil war. The Sunni the Shia and the Kurds never gotten along. In fact that country was drawn the borders of that country were drawn after World War I by Westerners that didn't understand what was happening there. The tragedy of it is that we're still embroiled. And frankly if there weren't weapons of mass destruction we should never have gone. I don't believe the United States should involve itself in civil wars. Civil wars are not in our direct interest and if you and look I served on a defense committee for 18 years and was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 by Secretary Rumsfeld to deal with some of the most serious problems that we faced.The fact is is that we should go to war when it is our direct interest. We should not be policemen of the world but when we go we mean business. We'll do our job. We'll tell our soldiers our people in the service take care of your job and then come home once we've accomplished our goals.That's what we need to do. Yeah. Well first of all those numbers incorrect. We are our Medicaid programs are coming in below cost estimates and our Medicaid program in the second year grew at 2.5 percent. And Kimberley let me tell you when we expand Medicaid and we treat the mentally ill then they don't live under a bridge or live in a prison where they cost $22500 a year.When we take the drug addicted and we treat them in the prisons we stop the revolving door of people in and out of prisons and we save $22500 a year.Guess what else? They get their lives back. And the working poor they're now getting health care. And you know that about a third of the people who are now getting that health care are people who are suffering very serious illnesses particularly cancer.So what I would tell you is we've gone from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. We've cut taxes by more than any governor in America by $5 billion. We have grown the number of jobs by 400000 private-sector jobs since I've been governor.Our credit is strong. Our pensions are strong. And frankly we leave no one behind. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We want everyone to rise and we will make them personally responsible for the help that they get.And that is exactly the program we're driving in Ohio. And boy people ought to look at Ohio because it has got a good formula. Yeah let me say a couple of things. First of all when Jeb was governor his first four years as governor he expand his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine. O.K.? It's just a fact.Now with Obamacare I've not only sued the administration I did not set up an exchange. And he knows that I'm not for Obamacare never have been. But here's what's interesting about Medicaid.You know who expanded Medicaid five times to try to help the folks and give them opportunity so that you could rise and get a job? President Ronald Reagan.Now the fact of the matter is we expanded to get people on their feet and once they're on their feet we are giving them the training and the efforts that they need to be able to get work and pull out of that situation. That's what we're doing in our state. Let me let's tell you... Major Major we can't we've got to look I have got to correct the record. And the fact of the matter is we went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. We're up 400000 jobs. Our credit is rock solid. And I don't know... Look the bottom line is the people of this of this country and this state want to see everybody rise and they want to see unity and I don't want to get into all this fighting tonight because people are frankly sick of the negative campaigning. And I'm going to stay positive about what I want to do from the... Before I get to that this is the ninth or 10th debate. What I've been watching here this back and forth and these attacks some of them are personal. I think we're fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don't stop this. I mean the fact is you know what? I would suggest why don't we take off all the negative ads and all the negative comments down from television and let us just talk about what we're for and let's sell that and the Republican Party will be stronger as a result... ... First of all I'm for sealing the border O.K.? And then I'm for a guest worker program. People can come in work and go back home. We haven't closed the border because special interests I believe blocked it. Then we have 11 and a half million people here. If they have not committed a crime since they've been here make them pay a fine and some back taxes and give them a path to legalization never to citizenship. It is not going to happen that we're going to run around and try to drag 11 and a half million people out of their homes.I'll tell you this. Within the first hundred days I will send a plan like this to the Congress of the United States and if I'm president I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts right now it will pass. That is a reasonable proposal that the people of this country in my judgment will support and so will the bulk of the Congress of the United States. You know John I think all people are the same. Look I did 106 town halls and I've been doing them left and right here in South Carolina. The first thing we have to do is grow the economy and I know the formula because I was chairman in Washington when we balanced the budget and created so many jobs and the same that we've been able to do in Ohio. You need common-sense regulations so small business can flourish you need lower taxes both on business and individuals and you need a fiscal plan to be able to get ourselves in a situation where people can predict a little bit about the future when it comes to the fiscal issues. And when you have that formula combined with work force that's trained you can explode the economy and create many jobs. I have done it twice and I want to go back to Washington and do it again.John the thing is is I think that there are people now these blue-collar Democrats my dad was a blue-collar Democrat the Democratic Party has left them. When they're arguing about being socialists they've left they have lost those blue-collar Democrats.And you know what I think they get out of me is my sense of what they get out of me and it's embarrassment about campaigns you brag about yourself.But I think I'm a uniter I think people sense it. I think they know I have the experience and that I'm a man that can give people hope and a sense that they have the opportunity rise. And I'll tell you I love these blue-collar Democrats because they're going to vote for us come next fall promise you that. Well I want to thank the people of South Carolina. You've been fantastic. And look what I want you to know is I'm going to send a lot of power money and influence back to where we all live. But as I've traveled around South Carolina I've noticed something. You know it's that people have a sense that you're not going to wait on a president. You know when I was a kid we didn't wait on presidents to come to that little blue-collar town and fix things. You know the Lord made all of us special. The Lord wants us to be connected. I believe we're part of a very big mosaic. And I'll send the power back. And whoever gets elected president here hopefully will take care of the issue of jobs and wages and Social Security and the border.But the spirit of the America rests in all of us. It's in our guts. It's taking care of our children. It's taking care of the lady next door who just lost her husband. It's fixing the schools where we live and telling kids to stay off drugs. You see I think what the Lord wants is for to us engage and in America the spirit of America doesn't come from the top down. The spirit of America rests in us. And I want to call on everyone in America to double down and realize that you were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone.Thank you all very much. And I hope I can have your vote in South Carolina.
2016-02-13 00:00:00,cruz," Well we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year. And let me say Justice Scalia... Eighty years of not confirming. For example L.B.J. nominated Abe Fortas. Fortas did not get confirmed. He was defeated. No Kennedy was confirmed in '87... He was appointed in... In this case it's both. But if I could answer the question... Justice Scalia was a legal giant. He was somebody that I knew for 20 years. He was a brilliant man. He was faithful to the Constitution. He changed the arc of American legal history. And I'll tell you his passing tonight our prayers are with his family with his wife Maureen who he adored his nine children his 36 grandkids. But it underscores the stakes of this election. We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states. We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision one of Justice Scalia's seminal decisions that upheld the Second Amendment right to keep and to bear arms. We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans and the stakes of this election for this year for the Senate the Senate needs to stand strong and say ""We're not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee.""And then for the state of South Carolina one of the most important judgments for the men and women of South Carolina to make is who on this stage has the background the principle the character the judgment and the strength of resolve to nominate and confirm principled constitutionalists to the court? That will be what I will do if I'm elected president. Well we need to focus on what the objective is you know? Your question about the first three questions you would ask in this Situation Room. I think it is a problem if the president commander in chief we've elected does not have the experience and background to understand the threats facing this country coming in on Day 1. If you look at the threats facing this country the single gravest threat national security threat is the threat of a nuclear Iran. That's why I've pledged on Day 1 to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal and anyone that thinks you can negotiate Khamenei does not understand the nature of Khamenei.When it comes to ISIS we've got to have a focused objective. One of the problems of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's foreign policy and sadly too many establishment Republicans in Washington is they focus on issues unrelated to protecting this country. They focus on nation building they focus on toppling governments to promote democracy and it ends up undermining our national security.Now with regard to ISIS we need a commander in chief that sets the objective we will utterly defeat them because they have declared war. They've declared a jihad on us.Now what do we need... ...to carry that out. We need overwhelming air power we need to arm the Kurds who can be our boots on the ground and if ground troops are necessary then we should employ them but it shouldn't be politicians demonstrating political toughness. It should be military expert judgment carrying out the objectives set out by the commander in chief. We have Kurds in both Iraq and Syria. They are fighting ISIS right now. They are winning victories right now. ISIS is using American military equipment they've seized in Iraq. And the Obama administration refuses to arm the Kurds the pesh merga the fighting forces who have been longtime allies. We ought to be arming them and letting them fight. Now if we need to embed Special Forces to direct our overwhelming air power if it is required to use ground troops to defeat ISIS we should use them but we ought to start with using our incredible air power advantage.The first Persian Gulf War we launched 1100 air attacks a day. Today we're launching between 15 and 30. We're not using the tools we have and it's because the commander in chief is not focused on defeating the enemy. Well let me say it at the outset that everyone here understands everyone understands that how that the middle class has been left behind in the last seven years of the Obama economy and we've got to bring jobs back. We've got to get people back to work. We've got to get wages going up again. We've got to get people moving from part-time work to full-time work. We all agree on that but it's not going to be solved with magic pixie dust. It's just going to be solved by declaring into the air ""Let there be jobs."" We actually have to understand the principles that made America great in the first place.Now where do you get economic growth? If you look at cause and effect over our nation's history every time we lessen the burden of Washington on small-business owners on job creators we see incredible economic growth. You do that through tax reform and regulatory reform.My tax plan typical family of four first $36000 you earn you pay nothing in taxes no income taxes no payroll taxes no nothing. Above 10 percent everyone pays the same simple flat 10 percent income rate. It's flat and fair. You can fill out your taxes on a postcard and we abolish the I.R.S. If you want to see the postcard I've got it on my website. Now Major the business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT. A VAT in Europe is a sales tax. The business flat tax is not a sales tax it is a tax of 16 percent opposed fairly and evenly across the board on all business. One of the things that's critical is we're doing that in conjunction with abolishing the corporate income tax with abolishing the Obamacare taxes with abolishing the payroll taxes which are the biggest taxes paid by most working Americans and with abolishing the death tax which is cruel and unfair. And you asked about economic growth the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated a simple flat tax that would produce 4.9 million new jobs it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyone's income by double digits.That's how you turn the country around not just hoping and praying for it but implementing policies that work. Well you know your question highlights a sharp difference on immigration on this stage. You know in a Republican primary everyone talks tough on immigration. Everyone is against illegal immigration in a Republican primary. But as voters we've been burned over and over again by people that give us a great campaign speech and they don't walk the walk. There are sharp differences on amnesty. If you look at the folks on this stage when Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and establishment Republicans were leading the fight to pass a massive amnesty plan I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American people and led the fight to defeat that amnesty plan. Now that moment... That moment was what Reagan would call ""a time for choosing."" When it comes to deciding which side of the line you're on the Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan... ...apparently supported by the donor class which is why Washington supported it. The Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan passed the Senate and it was on the verge of passing the House. House leadership intended to take it up and pass it with the Democrats overruling most of the Republicans. And the question for anyone on illegal immigration is where were you in that fight? Where did you stand?You are right. There is a difference between Senator Rubio and me on this question. Major I get a response to that. You know the lines are very very clear. Marco right now supports citizenship for 12 million people here illegally. I oppose citizenship. Marco stood on the debate stage and said that. But I would note not only that Marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty. In the state of Florida as speaker of the house he supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. In addition to that Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama's illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.I have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action including that one. And on the question... . That is simply... That is absolutely false. What he said is knowingly false. And I would note if you want to assess if you want to assess... ... who is telling the truth... If you want to assess who is telling the truth... ...then you should look to Jeff Sessions who said without Ted Cruz the Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill would have passed and Ted was responsible. You should look to Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin that said... I think it is a very important question because the people who have been hurt the most in the Obama economy had been the most vulnerable. It's been young people. It's been Hispanics. It's been African-Americans. It's been single moms. We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today in any year since 1977. And the sad reality is big government massive taxes massive regulation doesn't work. What we need to do instead is bring back booming economic growth let small businesses are the heart of the economy. Two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses. If we want to lift people out of poverty you know I think of these issues from the perspective of my dad.My dad fled Cuba in 1957. He was just 18. He couldn't speak English. He had nothing. He had $100 in his underwear. And he washed dishes making 50 cents an hour and paid his way through school. Today my dad is a pastor. He travels the country preaching the gospel.Now I think about all of these issues. How would it impact my dad when he was washing dishes? If we had Obamacare in place right now the odds are very high my father would have been laid off because it's teenaged kids like my dad who have gotten laid off. If he didn't get laid off the odds are high he would have had his hours forcibly reduced to 28 29 hours a week.We need to lift the burdens on small businesses so you have jobs and we need welfare reform that gets people off of welfare and back to work. You know flexibility is a good thing but it shouldn't you shouldn't be flexible on core principles. I like Donald he is an amazing entertainer but his policies for most of his life... For most of his life his policies have been very very liberal. For most of his life he has described himself as very pro- choice and as a supporter of partial birth abortion. Right now today as a candidate he supports federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. I disagree with him on that. That's a matter of principle and I'll tell you... Don I need to go on... I will say it is fairly remarkable to see Donald defending Ben after he called ""pathological"" and compared him to a child molester. Both of which were offensive and wrong. But let me say this you notice Donald didn't disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. And Donald has this weird pattern when you point to his own record he screams ""Liar liar liar."" You want to go... You want to go... If you want to watch the video go to our website at Tedcruz.org. You can see it out of Donald's own mouth. You supported it when we were battling over defunding Planned Parenthood. You went on... You said ""Planned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it."" So I'll tell you what... You see you and I... Don the reasoned principle matters. The reasoned principle matters sadly was illustrated by the first questions today. The next president is going to appoint one two three four Supreme Court justices. If Donald Trump is president he will appoint liberals. If Donald Trump is president your Second Amendment will gone... You know how I know that? I did not nominate John Roberts. I would not have nominated John Roberts. I supported... You need to learn to not interrupt people. Donald adults learn... Adults learn not to interrupt people. I did not nominate him. I would not have nominated him. I would've nominated my former boss Liberman who was Justice Scalia's first law clerk. And you know how I know that Donald's Supreme Court justices will be liberals? Because his entire life he support liberals from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry. In 2004 he contributed to John Kerry. Nobody who cares about judges would contribute to John Kerry Hillary Clinton Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid. That's what Donald Trump does. South Carolina you have a critical choice to make. Our country literally hangs in the balance. Do you want another Washington deal maker who will do business as usual cut deals with the Democrats grow government grow debt and give up our fundamental liberties? Or do you want a conservative a proven conservative that will stand and fight with you each and every day?Listen repealing Obamacare is not going to be easy. Passing a simple flat tax that abolishes the I.R.S. is not going to be easy but if we stand with the American people we can do it.And today we saw just how great the stakes are. Two branches of government hang in the balance. Not just the presidency but the Supreme Court. If we get this wrong if we nominate the wrong candidates the Second Amendment life marriage religious liberty every one of those hangs in the balance.My little girls are here. I don't want to look my daughters in the eyes and say ""We lost their liberties."" Who do you know will defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights? And as a commander in chief who do you know will stand up to our enemies as the clam steady deliberate strength to defeat our enemies to secure our borders and to keep America safe."
2016-02-13 00:00:00,dickerson," Good evening. I'm John Dickerson. This holiday weekend as America honors our first president we're about to hear from six men who hope to be the 45th. The candidates for the Republican nomination are here in South Carolina for their ninth debate one week before this state holds the first-in-the-South primary. George Washington wrote that the truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains taken to bring it to light. We hope to shed some light on the candidates' positions tonight to help voters make up their minds.So gentlemen please join us on stage. With us tonight with us tonight are retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson of Florida Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Businessman Donald Trump of New York. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida. And Governor John Kasich of Ohio. Now as most of you have heard by now Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died today at the age of 79. He was the longest-serving member of the court appointed by President Reagan in 1986. Justice Scalia was the court's leading conservative and even those who disagreed with his opinions regarded him as a brilliant legal scholar. Please join us and the candidates on our stage in a moment of silence for Justice Antonin Scalia. Thank you.We will talk to the candidates about Justice Scalia and the road ahead when the debate begins in a moment. Before we get started candidates here are the rules. When we ask you a question you will have one minute to answer and 30 seconds more if we ask a follow-up. If you're attacked by another candidate you get 30 seconds to respond. And here's how we keep time. After we ask a question you'll get a green light. The yellow light means you have 30 seconds left to finish your answer and when time is up the light turns red. That means please stop talking. If you keep talking you'll hear this. You don't want to hear that. Joining me in the questioning tonight my CBS News colleague chief White House correspondent Major Garrett and Kimberley Strassel who is on the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal.And you can participate in the debate through our partnership with Twitter. Tweet us your questions and comments using the hashtag ""#GOPDebate.""So let's begin.First the death of Justice Scalia and the vacancy that leaves on the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump I want to start with you. You've said that the president shouldn't nominate anyone in the rest of his term to replace Justice Scalia. If you were president and had a chance with 11 months left to go in your term wouldn't it be an abdication to conservatives in particular not to name a conservative justice with the rest of your term? So just to be clear on this Mr. Trump you're O.K. with the president nominating somebody ... Governor Kasich I want to get your thoughts on this. Justice Scalia was a real believer obviously in the strict word of the Constitution. Now Harry Reid says that a failure to fill his vacancy would be quote ""shameful abdication of one of the Senate's most essential constitutional responsibilities."" Where do you come down on this? Dr. Carson. Dr. Carson you like others put out a statement after the death was announced and you said the president should delay. You've written a book on the Constitution recently. What does the Constitution say about whose duty it is here to act in this kind of a situation? Senator Rubio you're a... Senator Rubio you're a lawyer. Quickly can you address the issue of whether the Constitution tells us who has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices? And then also the Senate Republicans last year floated an idea of removing the filibuster for Senate excuse me for Supreme Court nominations. You seemed open to that. What's your feeling on that now? Quickly though on this question... Very quickly Senator on this specific question though. You were once in favor of dropping the threshold... ... majority you were never in favor of that? O.K. Thank you Senator. Governor Bush I would like to ask you conservatives for a long time have felt like that their Republican presidents have picked justices that didn't turn out to be real conservatives. Bernie Sanders has said he would have a litmus test. He would make sure that he appointed a justice who was going to overturn Citizens United. If they can have a litmus test for a nominee what about you? Would you have a litmus test for a nominee? And what would it be? Right so Senator Cruz the Constitution... So Senator Cruz the Constitution says the president ""shall appoint with advice and consent from the Senate"" just to clear that up. So he has the constitutional power. But you don't think he should. Where do you set that date if you're president? Does it begin in election year in December November September? And once you set the date when you're president will you abide by that date? Just can I I'm sorry to interrupt were any appointed in an election year or is that just there were 80 years... But Kennedy was confirmed in '88. He was appointed in '87. ... confirmed in '88. That's the question is it appointing or confirming what's the difference? Sorry I just want to get the facts straight for the audience. But I apologize. All right. Thank you Senator Cruz. All right we're going to move on to national security here and we are going to I want to read a quote from Secretary Robert Gates former Defense Secretary Robert Gates who served for eight year under eight presidents.And this is what he said about Republican candidates quote ""Part of the concern that I have with the campaign is that the solutions being offered are so simplistic and so at odds with the way the world really works.""So in that spirit we're going to work tonight to be more specific.Mr. Trump I want to start with you. You have said as president you'll get up to speed very quickly. You'll know more quickly as president than any of the experts.So you've been elected president. It's your first day in the Situation Room. What three questions do you ask your national security experts about the world? Senator Rubio just 30 seconds on this question Senator Rubio. Are those the questions you would ask? Let me ask you a follow-up a full proper question then. Violent extremists are operating or active in 40 countries. Some 80 countries are in different degrees of instability. And so that's just the crises overseas. Barack Obama walked into an economic collapse when he came into office. We face international health crises from Ebola to Zika.So there is a lot of opportunity for crisis as you have talked about. What would you point to in your past to show voters that you've been in a crisis and that you've been tested when that inevitable crisis comes when you're president? Dr. Carson I want to ask you a question... Dr. Carson you said you've had more 2 a.m. 2 a.m. phone calls than anybody up on this stage. But when those 2 a.m. phone calls came you operated on a foundation of all of that amazing medical work that you did all of that learning. So if you were to be president though you wouldn't have the political foundation that hones those instincts when the 2 a.m. phone call comes. So isn't that a liability? Governor Kasich Russia is being credited... ...Russia is being credited with bombing U.S.-backed rebels on behalf of Assad in Aleppo and Syria. They've also moved into the Crimea eastern Ukraine. You've said you want to punch them in the nose. What does that mean? What are you going to do? Governor... ...Governor Bush. You said defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad. But wouldn't that also put us into conflict with Russia a country that supports Assad? So doesn't that mean effectively Assad's there to stay? Mr. Trump you're... ...Mr. Trump you were mentioned here. You did say that you could get along very well with Vladimir Putin. You did at one point say let Russia take care of ISIS... ... All right... ... All right Governor Bush please respond. ... O.K. settle... ... All right Mr. Trump all right... Gentleman I think we're going to leave that there. I've got a question for Senator... ... All right all right gentlemen gentlemen let's leave it there so I can ask a question of Senator Cruz who's also running for president. Senator Cruz you talked about the first Gulf War as being a kind of model for your focused and determined effort to go after ISIS. But there were 700000 ground troops as a part of that and you don't have a ground component to your plan. Why? Very quickly 30-second follow-up. You've said that essentially the Kurds would be the American ground forces in there. The criticism that experts have on that is that the Kurds only can work within their territory. If they take larger amounts of territory you have an ethnic war with the Arabs. So the Kurds can't really do as much as you seem to be putting on their backs. All right. Mr. Trump... ...On Monday George W. Bush will campaign in South Carolina for his brother. As you've said tonight and you've often said the Iraq war and your opposition to it was a sign of your good judgment. In 2008 in an interview with Wolf Blitzer talking about President George W. Bush's conduct of the war you said you were surprised that Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi didn't try to impeach him.You said quote: ""Which personally I think would have been a wonderful thing."" When you were asked what you meant by that and you said: ""For the war for the war he lied he got us into the war with lies."" Do you still believe President Bush should have been impeached? So... But so I'm going to so you still think he should be impeached? All right. O.K. All right. Governor Bush when a member on the stage's brother gets attacked... ... the brother gets to respond. Governor Kasich would you weigh in on... ...Governor Kasich please weigh in. Why is it nuts? Talk about it. Give us your sense of... Thirty seconds Senator Rubio. All right Dr. Carson we have a cleansing... We have a cleansing... All right. Well Dr. Carson I have got a question now for you. A moment of pause here. You have said Dr. Carson that referring to yourself that people bought into the idea that quote ""A nice person can't be tough on terrorists.""You have called for loosening the rules of engagement for the military which could lead to more civilian casualties.So explain why those casualties would be acceptable in the fight against ISIS? All right thank you Dr. Carson. We're going to have to take a commercial break here. Thank you to all the candidates. We'll be right back with CBS News's 2016 debate in Greenville South Carolina. We're back with the Republicans who could be president. The topic now is money and how the candidates would spend it. We'll turn the questioning over to Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal and Major Garrett of CBS News. Kim? Dr. Carson before we go to break could you give us your sense of this conversation about either Medicaid or economic growth through taxation? Doctor... ... Dr. Carson I'm sorry we have to go to a commercial. The free market wants what it wants. Back soon with the 2016 Republican debate in Greenville South Carolina. Welcome back. We'll begin the second half of the debate with one of the hottest issues in the Republican campaign immigration. But before I turn it back to Major Garrett and Kim Strassel I have one question for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump in the Republican National Committee's Spanish-language response to the State of the Union Congressman Diaz-Balart said quote ""It's essential that we find a legislative solution"" talking about immigration ""to offer a permanent and humane solution to those who live in the shadows. What does that mean to you ""a humane solution to those who live in the shadows""? Senator Cruz I have a question for you. Speaker Paul Ryan has made a big commitment to trying to lift the 50 million poor out of poverty. Arthur Brooks who is the president of the American Enterprise Institute says quote ""If we are not warriors for the poor every day free enterprise has no matter."" How you have been in your campaign a warrior for the poor? All right. Mr. Trump thank you so much. We're going to take a break for a moment. We'll be back in a moment with the CBS News Republican debate. We're back now from Greenville South Carolina with the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Trump I have a question for you. Presidents have to on the one hand be firm but also be flexible.You have been flexible and changed your opinion on a number of things from abortion to Hillary Clinton. But you have said rightly that it's just like Ronald Reagan who changed his mind on things.But at the same time you're criticizing Senator Cruz for what you say is a change on immigration. He disputes that of course.So why is your change of opinion make you like Reagan and when he changes his opinion it's a huge character flaw? Which conservative idea don't you agree with? All right. Governor Bush I think by ""they"" he is referring to your brother these on the hook for your brother. But that was his brother. Hold on gentleman I'm going to turn this car around. All right gentlemen. Well hold on. We're going to gentlemen we're in danger of driving this into the dirt. Senator Rubio I'd like you to jump in here... I understand you're on deck governor. Senator Cruz 30 seconds on this one. We're going to switch... We're going to switch here to Senator Marco Rubio. Senator Marco Rubio please weigh in. I thought you had a point? I thought you had a point you wanted to make. You're on deck sir. Senator I wanted to ask you just going back to immigration in the last debate you listed your series of accomplishments in the Senate. One thing you left off was was immigration reform. Is it the case that in your list of accomplishments you can't mention that? Dr. Carson I have... ...Dr. Carson I have a question for you. Candidates are... All right. You have 30 seconds Doctor. Dr. Carson I let me ask you a different question. When you were you were the first one really to talk about political correctness. Everybody now talks about it but that was really what sparked your your rise. Politicians are often accused of glossing over any hard choices people have to make just always selling happy nice things. So in the in the spirit of saying something that might be politically incorrect tell the voters something that they need to hear but that might be politically incorrect? Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich you've been described as the Democrats' favorite Republican. You talked about in New Hampshire Democrats would come up to you and say ""I hope you win."" Why will that help you win a Republican nomination? Mr. Trump let me ask you a question. Presidents in both parties say that the one thing you need in your administration is somebody who can tell you you're wrong. You don't necessarily seem like somebody who has somebody who tells you you're wrong a lot. Can you tell us of an instance where somebody has said ""Donald Trump you're wrong"" and you listened to them? About what? Let me something in talking to voters that they wish somebody would tell you to cut it out is the profanity. What's your reaction to that? All right. O.K. Governor Bush I'd like to ask you... Well can I how about you respond and then you can answer the question I'm about to ask you. It'll be... If we adjudicate this the night will be over. Governor in 2012 you said that your father and Ronald Reagan would have a hard time in today's Republican Party based on their records of trying to find accommodation and finding some degree of common ground.Do you still feel that way? Hold on Mr. Trump. Hold on Mr. Trump. O.K. Mr. Trump your response. The bells are ringing sir. All right. Thank you. Senator Rubio I want to ask you a 30-second question no president can... No well I'll ask the question you do what you want. No president can know everything right? So a smart leader knows how to ask questions. So if you could talk to any previous president what's the smart question you would ask about that job that you would want to know? All right. That's going to have to be it there Senator Rubio. We have got to go to a break. We will be right back with the CBS News Republican debate in Greenville South Carolina. Time now for closing statements. You will each have one minute and we'll begin with Governor Kasich. Dr. Carson Dr. Carson you're next. Governor Governor Bush. Senator Cruz? Senator Cruz your closing statement? Mr. Trump your closing statements?"
2015-10-13 00:00:00,webb," Thank you. You know people are disgusted with the way that money has corrupted our political process intimidating incumbents and empowering Wall Street every day the turnstile government that we see and also the power of the financial sector in both parties. They're looking for a leader who understands how the system works who has not been coopted by it and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things. I have a record of working across the political aisle. I've also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author a journalist and a sole proprietor. In government service I've fought and bled for our country in Vietnam as a Marine. I spent years as Assistant Secretary of Defense Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration. In the senate I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. I also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill. I brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. I led what later became called the Strategic Pivot to Asia two years before President Obama was elected. I know where my loyalties are. My mother grew up in the poverty of east Arkansas chopping cotton picking strawberries. Three of her seven siblings died in childhood. My wife Hong came to this country as a refugee from war torn Vietnam learned English a language that was not spoken at home and earned her way into Cornell Law School. I have five daughters. Amy works with disabled veterans Sarah is an emergency room nurse Julia is a massage therapist Emily and Georgia are still in school. My son Jim fought as an infantry Marine on the bloody streets of Ramadi. You may be sure that in a Webb administration the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy. No actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party and the reason I've decided to run as a Democrat has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race. And as a clarification I have always supported affirmative action for African Americans. That's the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed. What I have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone quote ""of color"" other than whites struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian mountains we're not being true to the Democratic Party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have by culture by the way. Look there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. We need to pay respect to both of them. The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. And we have done not a good job on that. A lot of them are criminals. And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. And the shooting in Virginia Tech in '07 this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information. So we do need background checks. We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence. May I? People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here. There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day seven days a week. The average American does not have that and deserves the right to be able to protect their family. Anderson can I come into this discussion at some point? Thank you. I've been standing over here for about ten minutes trying. It's just it's gone back and forth over there. You got the lucky . Look let's start I've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes let's start with why Russia is in Syria right now. There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon which sent bad signals bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world. Now I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq whose son fought in Iraq I've fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy a focus the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people. And I would say this. I've been waiting for 10 minutes. I will say this. I will well you've let a lot of people go over their time. I would say this... ... to the unelected authoritarian government of China: You do not own the South China Sea. You do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of American citizens. And in a Webb administration we will do something about that. Can I... Thank you. This is not about Benghazi per se. To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya. We had no treaties at risk. We had no Americans at risk. There was no threat of attack or imminent attack. There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation. I called for it on the Senate floor again and again. I called for it in Senate hearings. It is not a wise thing to do. And if people think it was a wise thing to do try to get to the Tripoli airport today. You can't do it. Everybody makes their decisions when the time there is conscription. And as long as they go through the legal process that our country requires I respect that. And it would be for the voters to decide whether Senator Sanders or anyone else should be president. I will say this coming from the position that I've come from from a military family with my brother a marine my son was a marine in Iraq I served as a marine spending five years in the Pentagon I am comfortable that I am the most qualified person standing up here today to be your commander-in-chief. I believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran's greater position on this very important balance of power among our greatest ally Israel and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime and Iran. It was a position of weakness and I think it encouraged the acts that we've seen in the past several weeks. Our greatest long-term strategic challenge is our relation with China. Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country. Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East. Thank you. You know people are disgusted with the way that money has corrupted our political process intimidating incumbents and empowering Wall Street every day the turnstile government that we see and also the power of the financial sector in both parties. They're looking for a leader who understands how the system works who has not been coopted by it and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things. I have a record of working across the political aisle. I've also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author a journalist and a sole proprietor. In government service I've fought and bled for our country in Vietnam as a Marine. I spent years as Assistant Secretary of Defense Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration. In the senate I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. I also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill. I brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. I led what later became called the Strategic Pivot to Asia two years before President Obama was elected. I know where my loyalties are. My mother grew up in the poverty of east Arkansas chopping cotton picking strawberries. Three of her seven siblings died in childhood. My wife Hong came to this country as a refugee from war torn Vietnam learned English a language that was not spoken at home and earned her way into Cornell Law School. I have five daughters. Amy works with disabled veterans Sarah is an emergency room nurse Julia is a massage therapist Emily and Georgia are still in school. My son Jim fought as an infantry Marine on the bloody streets of Ramadi. You may be sure that in a Webb administration the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy. No actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been. The Democratic Party and the reason I've decided to run as a Democrat has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. And that is not determined by race. And as a clarification I have always supported affirmative action for African Americans. That's the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed. What I have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone quote ""of color"" other than whites struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian mountains we're not being true to the Democratic Party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have by culture by the way. Look there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. We need to pay respect to both of them. The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. And we have done not a good job on that. A lot of them are criminals. And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. And the shooting in Virginia Tech in '07 this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information. So we do need background checks. We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence. May I? People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here. There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day seven days a week. The average American does not have that and deserves the right to be able to protect their family. Anderson can I come into this discussion at some point? Thank you. I've been standing over here for about ten minutes trying. It's just it's gone back and forth over there. You got the lucky . Look let's start I've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes let's start with why Russia is in Syria right now. There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. The first was the invasion of Iraq which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran. The second was the Arab Spring which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon which sent bad signals bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world. Now I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq whose son fought in Iraq I've fought in Vietnam. But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy a focus the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China. And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people. And I would say this. I've been waiting for 10 minutes. I will say this. I will well you've let a lot of people go over their time. I would say this... ... to the unelected authoritarian government of China: You do not own the South China Sea. You do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of American citizens. And in a Webb administration we will do something about that. Can I... Thank you. This is not about Benghazi per se. To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya. We had no treaties at risk. We had no Americans at risk. There was no threat of attack or imminent attack. There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation. I called for it on the Senate floor again and again. I called for it in Senate hearings. It is not a wise thing to do. And if people think it was a wise thing to do try to get to the Tripoli airport today. You can't do it. Everybody makes their decisions when the time there is conscription. And as long as they go through the legal process that our country requires I respect that. And it would be for the voters to decide whether Senator Sanders or anyone else should be president. I will say this coming from the position that I've come from from a military family with my brother a marine my son was a marine in Iraq I served as a marine spending five years in the Pentagon I am comfortable that I am the most qualified person standing up here today to be your commander-in-chief.

Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country. Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East."
2015-10-13 00:00:00,sanders," Anderson thank you very much. I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises. The middle class of this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing. Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top one percent. As a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining American democracy. Millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super PACs and to elect candidates who represent their interests not the interests of working people. Today the scientific community is virtually unanimous: climate change is real it is caused by human activity and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren. Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent. It seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration maybe just maybe we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids. What this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires and create the vibrant democracy we know we can and should have. Thank you. Well we're gonna win because first we're gonna explain what democratic socialism is. And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent almost own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That it is wrong today in a rigged economy that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. That when you look around the world you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right except the United States. You see every other major country saying to moms that when you have a baby we're not gonna separate you from your newborn baby because we are going to have we are gonna have medical and family paid leave like every other country on Earth. Those are some of the principles that I believe in and I think we should look to countries like Denmark like Sweden and Norway and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people. Well first of all let's look at the facts. The facts that are very simple. Republicans win when there is a low voter turnout and that is what happened last November. Sixty-three percent of the American people didn't vote Anderson. Eighty percent of young people didn't vote. We are bringing out huge turnouts and creating excitement all over this country. Democrats at the White House on down will win when there is excitement and a large voter turnout and that is what this campaign is doing. Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No I don't. I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires. I think everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation. We have got to encourage that. Of course we have to support small and medium-sized businesses. But you can have all of the growth that you want and it doesn't mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. So what we need to do is support small and medium-sized businesses the backbone of our economy but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake... ... not just for billionaires. Let's begin Anderson by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating (ph) from the NRA. Let's also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress way back then I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont a state which has virtually no gun control that I supported a ban on assault weapons. And over the years I have strongly avoided instant background checks doing away with this terrible gun show loophole. And I think we've got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers. Also I believe and I've fought for to understand that there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal who are homicidal but can't get the healthcare that they need the mental healthcare because they don't have insurance or they're too poor. I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately. Of course not. This was a large and complicated bill. There were provisions in it that I think made sense. For example do I think that a gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody and that somebody goes out and does something crazy that that gun shop owner should be held responsible? I don't. On the other hand where you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that of course we should take action. As a senator from a rural state what I can tell Secretary Clinton that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing. I believe that there is a consensus in this country. A consensus has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks do away with this gun show loophole that we have to address the issue of mental health that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue and that when we develop that consensus we can finally finally do something to address this issue. I think the governor gave a very good example about the weaknesses in that law and I think we have to take another look at it. But here is the point Governor. We can raise our voices but I come from a rural state and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states whether we like it or not. Our job is to bring people together around strong commonsense gun legislation. I think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing and I intend to lead the country in bringing our people together. It's exactly about rural. Governor... Well as somebody who has a D-minus voting record... I don't think I am pandering. But you have not been in the United States Congress. And when you want to check it out. And if you think if you think that we can simply go forward and pass something tomorrow without bringing people together you are sorely mistaken. ...Excuse me... ...I want to make... Well let's understand that when we talk about Syria you're talking about a quagmire in a quagmire. You're talking about groups of people trying to overthrow Assad other groups of people fighting ISIS. You're talking about people who are fighting ISIS using their guns to overthrow Assad and vice versa. I'm the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee and in that capacity I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war and I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country. We should be putting together a coalition of Arab countries who should be leading the effort. We should be supportive but I do not support American ground troops in Syria. Let me just respond to something the secretary said. First of all she is talking about as I understand it a no-fly zone in Syria which I think is a very dangerous situation. Could lead to real problems. Second of all I heard the same evidence from President Bush and Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld about why we should overthrow Saddam Hussein and get involved in the I would urge people to go to berniesanders.com hear what I said in 2002. And I say without any joy in my heart that much of what I thought would happen about the destabilization in fact did happen. So I think... I think the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here and that is to support those people who are against Assad against ISIS without getting us on the ground there and that's the direction I believe we should have (inaudible). Well obviously I voted when President Clinton said ""let's stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo"" I voted for that. I voted to make sure that Osama bin Laden was held accountable in Afghanistan. When our country is threatened or when our allies are threatened I believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country. I do not support the United States getting involved in unilateral action. ( UNKNOWN ): You're at work with our allies. I don't believe that any... Pardon me? Well I think Mr. Putin is going to regret what he is doing. I think that when he gets into that... Well I think he's already regretting what he did in Crimea and what he is doing in the Ukraine. I think he is really regretting the decline of his economy. And I think what he is trying to do now is save some face. But I think when Russians get killed in Syria and when he gets bogged down I think the Russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home maybe they should start working with the United States to rectify the situation now. Well first of all let me applaud my good friend Jim Webb for his service to this country in so many ways. Jim and I under Jim's leadership as he indicated passed the most significant veterans education bill in recent history. We followed suit with a few years later passing under my leadership the most significant veterans' health care legislation in the modern history of this country. When I was a young man I'm not a young man today. When I was a young man I strongly opposed the war in Vietnam. Not the brave men like Jim who fought in that war but the policy which got us involved in that war. That was my view then. I am not a pacifist Anderson. I supported the war in Afghanistan. I supported President Clinton's effort to deal with ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. I support air strikes in Syria and what the president is trying to do. Yes I happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy. But yes I am prepared to take this country into war if that is necessary. The scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable. That is a major crisis. Let me say this. Let me say let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the secretary is right and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails. You know? The middle class Anderson and let me say something about the media as well. I go around the country talk to a whole lot of people. Middle class in this country is collapsing. We have 27 million people living in poverty. We have massive wealth and income inequality. Our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs. The American people want to know whether we're going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of Citizens Union. Enough of the e-mails. Let's talk about the real issues facing America. Anderson thank you very much. I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises. The middle class of this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing. Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top one percent.

2015-10-13 00:00:00,cooper," I'm Anderson Cooper. Thanks for joining us. We've already welcomed the candidates on stage. They are in place at their podiums. Before we dive into the issues I want to quickly explain some of the groundrules tonight. As the moderator I'll ask questions followups and guide the discussion. I'll be joined in the questioning by CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez and Dana Bash a well as Don Lemon who will share questions from Democrats around the country. Each candidate will get one minute to answer questions and 30 seconds for followups and rebuttals. I'll give candidates time to respond if they have been singled out for criticism. Our viewers should know that we have lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. I want the candidates to be able to introduce themselves to our audience. Each candidate will have two minutes to introduce themselves. Let's begin with Governor Chafee. Governor? Thank you very much Governor. Senator Webb you have two minutes. Governor O'Malley you have two minutes. Governor O'Malley thank you very much. Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton? Thank you all. It is time to start the debate. Are you all ready? All right. Let's begin. We're going to be discussing a lot of the issues many of the issues important issues that you have brought up. But I want to begin with concerns that voters have about each of the candidates here on this stage that they have about each of you. Secretary Clinton I want to start with you. Plenty of politicians evolve on issues but even some Democrats believe you change your positions based on political expediency. You were against same-sex marriage. Now you're for it. You defended President Obama's immigration policies. Now you say they're too harsh. You supported his trade deal dozen of times. You even called it the ""gold standard"". Now suddenly last week you're against it. Will you say anything to get elected? Secretary Clinton though with all due respect the question is really about political expediency. Just in July New Hampshire you told the crowd you'd quote ""take a back seat to no one when it comes to progressive values."" Last month in Ohio you said you plead guilty to quote ""being kind of moderate and center."" Do you change your political identity based on who you're talking to? Just for the record are you a progressive or are you a moderate? Secretary... ...thank you... ...Senator... Senator Sanders. A Gallup poll says half the country would not put a socialist in the White House. You call yourself a democratic socialist. How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States? Denmark is a country that has a population Denmark is a country that has a population of 5.6 million people. The question is really about electability here and that's what I'm trying to get at. You the the Republican attack ad against you in a general election it writes itself. You supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. You honeymooned in the Soviet Union. And just this weekend you said you're not a capitalist. Doesn't doesn't that ad write itself? You don't consider yourself a capitalist though? Just let me just be clear. Is there anybody else on the stage who is not a capitalist? Senator Sanders? We're going to get... We're going to have a lot more on these issues. But I do want to just quickly get everybody in on the question of electability. Governor Chafee you've been everything but a socialist. When you were senator from Rhode Island you were a Republican. When you were elected governor you were an independent. You've only been a Democrat for little more than two years. Why should Democratic voters trust you won't change again? It seems like pretty soft granite. I mean you've been a Republican you've been an independent. Then why change labels? Governor O'Malley the concern of voters about you is that you tout our record as Baltimore's mayor. As we all know we all saw it. That city exploded in riots and violence in April. The current top prosecutor in Baltimore also a Democrat blames your zero tolerance policies for sowing the seeds of unrest. Why should Americans trust you with the country when they see what's going on in the city that you ran for more than seven years? She actually just for the record when she was asked which policies to name two she said zero tolerance. I mean there's a number of old policies that we're seeing the results of. That distress of communities where communities don't want to step forward and say who killed a 3-year-old it's a direct result of these failed policies. In one year alone though 100000 arrests were made in your city a city of 640000 people. The ACLU the NAACP sued you sued the city and the city actually settled saying a lot of those arrests were without probable cause. Thank you Governor. Senator Webb in 2006 you called affirmative action ""state-sponsored racism."" In 2010 you wrote an op/ed saying it discriminates against whites. Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is non-white aren't you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now? Senator Webb thank you very much. Let's move on to some of the most pressing issues facing our country right now some of the biggest issues right now in the headlines today. We're going to start with guns. The shooting in Oregon earlier this month once again it brought the issue of guns into the national conversation. Over the last week guns have been the most discussed political topic on Facebook by two to one. Senator Sanders you voted against the Brady bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period. You also supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on Amtrak trains. For a decade you said that holding gun manufacturers legally responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea. Now you say you're reconsidering that. Which is it: shield the gun companies from lawsuits or not? Do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits? Secretary Clinton is Bernie Sanders tough enough on guns? We're going to bring you all in on this. But Senator Sanders you have to give a response. Governor O'Malley you passed gun legislation as governor of Maryland but you had a Democratic-controlled legislature. President Obama couldn't convince Congress to pass gun legislation after the massacres in Aurora in Newtown and Charleston. How can you? Senator Sanders I want you to be able to respond 30 seconds. Let me bring in somebody who has a different viewpoint. Senator Webb your rating from the NRA you once had an A rating from the NRA. You've said gun violence goes down when more people are allowed to carry guns. Would encouraging more people to be armed be part of your response to a mass shooting? Senator... Senator Governor Chafee you have an F rating from the NRA what do you think about what Senator Webb just said? I want to... ...I want to move on to another issue which is in the headlines right now another crisis making headlines. Secretary Clinton Russia they're challenging the U.S. in Syria. According to U.S. intelligence they've lied about who they're bombing. You spearheaded the reset with Russia. Did you underestimate the Russians and as president what would your response to Vladimir Putin be right now in Syria? Senator Sanders what would you do differently. On this issue of foreign policy I want to go to... I want to go to Dana Bash. Dana? But Senator Sanders you didn't answer the question. Under what under what circumstances would you actually use force? I'm gonna bring you all in on this. Governor Governor O'Malley Secretary Clinton... Secretary Clinton voted to authorize military force in Iraq supported more troops in Afghanistan. As Secretary of State she wanted to arm Syrian rebels and push for the bombing of Libya. Is she too quick to use military force? Does she does she want to use military force too rapidly? Governor O'Malley just for the record on the campaign trail you've been saying that Secretary Clinton is always quick for the for the military intervention. Senator Secretary Clinton you can respond. Well yes you'll be coming in next but she was directly quoted Senator. OK. Secretary? Thank you. Thank you Secretary. Senator Webb you said as president you would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was in your words ""inevitable."" Should Secretary Clinton have seen that attack coming? Senator... You're over your time as of now. You agreed to these debate rules. Senator Sanders I want you to be able to respond. I'd like you to be able to respond and get in on this. He doesn't seem to be the type of guy to regret a lot. Secretary Clinton on the campaign trail Governor Webb has said that he would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was inevitable. Should you have seen that attack coming? But American citizens did lose their lives in Benghazi. Governor O'Malley? Senator Webb I want you to be able to respond. Senator Webb? Secretary (sic) Webb you served in Vietnam. You're a marine. Once a marine always a marine. You served as a marine in Vietnam. You're a decorated war hero. You eventually became secretary of the navy. During the Vietnam War the man standing next to you Senator Sanders applied for status as a conscientious objector. Given his history can he serve as a credible commander-in-chief? Senator Sanders tell an American soldier who is watching right now tonight in Afghanistan why you can be commander-in- chief given that you applied for conscientious objector status. Very quickly 30 seconds for each of you. Governor Chafee who or what is the greatest national security threat to the United States? I want to go down the line. OK. Senator I can give you 30 seconds to respond. Thirty seconds for each of you. Governor Chafee what is the greatest national security threat to the United States? OK. Governor O'Malley? Secretary Clinton the greatest national security threat? Senator Sanders greatest national security threat? Senator Webb? All right. We're going to take a short break. Do these candidates see eye to eye on an issue that is driving a big wedge between Republicans? That is next. We'll be right back. And welcome back. We are live in Nevada in Las Vegas at the Wynn Resort for the first Democratic presidential debate. The questions continue. We begin with Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton you are going to be testifying before Congress next week about your e-mails. For the last eight months you haven't been able to put this issue behind you. You dismissed it; you joked about it; you called it a mistake. What does that say about your ability to handle far more challenging crises as president? Secretary... Secretary Clinton Secretary Clinton with all due respect it's a little hard I mean isn't it a little bit hard to call this just a partisan issue? There's an FBI investigation and President Obama himself just two days ago said this is a legitimate issue. Thank you. Senator Sanders? It's obviously very popular in this crowd and it's hold on. I know that plays well in this room. But I got to be honest Governor Chafee for the record on the campaign trail you've said a different thing. You said this is a huge issue. Standing here in front of Secretary Clinton are you willing to say that to her face? Secretary Clinton do you want to respond? Governor Governor... Governor O'Malley... Governor it's popular in the room but a lot of people do want to know these answers. Governor O'Malley you expressed concern on the campaign trail that the Democratic Party is and I quote ""being defined by Hillary Clinton's email scandal."" You heard her answer do you still feel that way tonight? ...Thank you governor. I want to talk about issues of race in America for that I want to start of with Don Lemon. The question from Arthur... ...Do black lives matter or do all lives matter? Let's put nto the issues I want to quickly explain some of the groundrules tonight. As the moderator I'll ask questions followups and guide the discussion. I'll be joined in the questioning by CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez and Dana Bash a well as Don Lemon who will share questions from Democrats around the country. Each candidate will get one minute to answer questions and 30 seconds for followups and rebuttals. I'll give candidates time to respond if they have been singled out for criticism. Our viewers should know that we have lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. I want the candidates to be able to introduce themselves to our audience. Each candidate will have two minutes to introduce themselves. Let's begin with Governor Chafee. Governor? Thank you very much Governor. Senator Webb you have two minutes. Governor O'Malley you have two minutes. Governor O'Malley thank you very much. Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton? Thank you all. It is time to start the debate. Are you all ready? All right. Let's begin. We're going to be discussing a lot of the issues many of the issues important issues that you have brought up. But I want to begin with concerns that voters have about each of the candidates here on this stage that they have about each of you. Secretary Clinton I want to start with you. Plenty of politicians evolve on issues but even some Democrats believe you change your positions based on political expediency. You were against same-sex marriage. Now you're for it. You defended President Obama's immigration policies. Now you say they're too harsh. You supported his trade deal dozen of times. You even called it the ""gold standard"". Now suddenly last week you're against it. Will you say anything to get elected? Secretary Clinton though with all due respect the question is really about political expediency. Just in July New Hampshire you told the crowd you'd quote ""take a back seat to no one when it comes to progressive values."" Last month in Ohio you said you plead guilty to quote ""being kind of moderate and center."" Do you change your political identity based on who you're talking to? Just for the record are you a progressive or are you a moderate? Secretary... ...thank you... ...Senator... Senator Sanders. A Gallup poll says half the country would not put a socialist in the White House. You call yourself a democratic socialist. How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States? Denmark is a country that has a population Denmark is a country that has a population of 5.6 million people. The question is really about electability here and that's what I'm trying to get at. You the the Republican attack ad against you in a general election it writes itself. You supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. You honeymooned in the Soviet Union. And just this weekend you said you're not a capitalist. Doesn't doesn't that ad write itself? You don't consider yourself a capitalist though? Just let me just be clear. Is there anybody else on the stage who is not a capitalist? Senator Sanders? We're going to get... We're going to have a lot more on these issues. But I do want to just quickly get everybody in on the question of electability. Governor Chafee you've been everything but a socialist. When you were senator from Rhode Island you were a Republican. When you were elected governor you were an independent. You've only been a Democrat for little more than two years. Why should Democratic voters trust you won't change again? It seems like pretty soft granite. I mean you've been a Republican you've been an independent. Then why change labels? Governor O'Malley the concern of voters about you is that you tout our record as Baltimore's mayor. As we all know we all saw it. That city exploded in riots and violence in April.

2015-10-13 00:00:00,chafee, Thank you Anderson. Thank you CNN and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate. Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year we also will be electing a world leader. Voters should assess the candidate's experience character and vision for the future as they make this important decision. I'm the only one running for president that has been a mayor a United States senator and a governor. As mayor I brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down. I was reelected three times. As a senator I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the Bush-Cheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy against the tragedy of the Iraq war for environmental stewardship for protection of our civil liberties. I served on the Foreign Relations Committee and I chaired the Middle East Subcommittee for four years. As governor I came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around. Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state. It happens to be Nevada where we're having this debate. I'm very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service I have had no scandals. I've always been honest. I have the courage to take the long-term view and I've shown good judgment. I have high ethical standards. As we look to the future I want to address the income inequality close the gap between the haves and the have-nots. I want to address climate change a real threat to our planet. And I believe in prosperity through peace. I want to end these wars. I look forward to the discussion ahead. Thank you Anderson you're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. Whether it's... Did you hear what I said? On the issues. I have not changed on the issues. I was a liberal Republican then I was an independent and now I'm a proud Democrat. But I have not changed on the issues. And I open my record to scrutiny. Whether it's on the environment a woman's right to choose gay marriage fiscal responsibility aversion to foreign entanglements using the tools of government to help the less fortunate. Time and time again I have never changed. You're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues. So I have not changed. The party left me. There's no doubt about that. There was no room for a liberal moderate Republican in that party. I even had a primary for my reelection in 2006. I won it. But the money poured in to defeat me in Rhode Island as a Republican. That's what we were up against. Yes I have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation but the reality is despite these tragedies that happen time and time again when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they're coming to take away your guns. And they're successful at it in Colorado and others states the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated. I even saw in Rhode Island. So I would bring the gun lobby in and say we've got to change this. Where can we find common ground? Wayne Lapierre from the NRA whoever it is the leaders. Come one we've go to change this. We're not coming to take away your guns we believe in the Second Amendment but let's find common ground here. Well we just heard Senator Sanders say that it's the worst decision in American history. That's very significant the worst decision in American history I just heard from Senator Sanders. So as we look ahead if you're going to make those poor judgment calls a critical time in our history we just finished with the Vietnam era getting back into another quagmire if you're looking ahead and you're looking at someone who made that poor decision in 2002 to go into Iraq when there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq I know because I did my homework and so that's an indication of how someone will perform in the future. And that's what's important. OK. I just have to answer one thing that Senator Webb said about the Iran deal because I'm a strong proponent of what President Obama and he said that because of that the Iran deal that enabled Russia to come in. No that's not true Senator Webb. I respect your foreign policy chops. But Russia is aligned with Iran and with Assad and the Alawite Shias in Syria. So that Iran deal did not allow Russia to come in. It's certainly the chaos in the Middle East. There's no doubt about it. And it all started with the Iraq invasion. Absolutely. We have to repair American credibility after we told the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction which he didn't. So there's an issue of American credibility out there. So any time someone is running to be our leader and a world leader which the American president is credibility is an issue out there with the world. And we have repair work to be done. I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president. That's how I feel. Thank you Anderson. Thank you CNN and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate. Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year we also will be electing a world leader. Voters should assess the candidate's experience character and vision for the future as they make this important decision.

2015-10-13 00:00:00,moderators, Anderson Cooper (CNN); Dana Bash (CNN); Don Lemon (CNN); and Juan Carlos Lopez (CNN en Espanol)
2015-10-13 00:00:00,o'malley," My name is Martin O'Malley former Mayor of Baltimore former governor of Maryland a life long democrat and most importantly a husband and a father. My wife Katie and I have four great kids Grace and Tara and William and Jack. And like you there is nothing we wouldn't do to give them healthier and better lives. There are some things that I have learned to do better in life than others. And after 15 years of executive experience I have learned how to be an effective leader. Whether it was raising the minimum wage making our public schools the best in America passing marriage equality the DREAM Act and comprehensive gun safety legislation I have learned how to get things done because I am very clear about my principals. Thanks to President Obama our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008. Our country's doing better we are creating jobs again. But we elected a president not a magician and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now. For there is a deep injustice an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart and it will not solve itself. Injustice does not solve itself. What I'm talking about is this our middle class is shrinking. Our poor families are becoming poorer and 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago. We need new leadership and we need action. The sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all American families. Our economy isn't money it's people. It's all of our people and so we must invest in our country and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt. And we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity. The future is what we make of it. We are all in this together. And the question in this election is whether you and I still have the ability to give our kids a better future. I believe we do that is why I am running for president and I need your help. Thank you. Yes actually I believe what she said was that there's a lot of policies that have led to this unrest. But Anderson when I ran for mayor of Baltimore in 1999... Well let's talk about this a little bit. One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38-year low in the year prior to the Freddie Gray's tragic death. Anderson when I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999 it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent addicted and abandoned city in America. And I ran and promised people that together we could turn that around. And we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime or part one (ph) crime by more than any other major city in America over the next 10 years. I did not make our city immune to setbacks. But I attended a lot of funerals including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor African-American neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner. We've saved over a thousand lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together. And the vast majority of them were young and poor and black. It wasn't easy on any day. But we saved lives and we gave our city a better future improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office. Well I think the key word in your followup there was the word ""settle."" That's true. It was settled. Arrests peaked in 2003 Anderson but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime. Look none of this is easy. None of us has all the answers. But together as a city we saved a lot of lives. It was about leadership. It was about principle. And it was about bringing people together. Thank you. And Anderson I also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done. Look it's fine to talk about all of these things and I'm glad we're talking about these things but I've actually done them. We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said. We actually did it. And Anderson here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very very real. Sandy and Lonnie Phillips are here from Colorado. And their daughter Jessie was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora. Now to try to transform their grief they went to court where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court but in this case you want to talk about a a rigged game Senator? The game was rigged. A man had sold 4000 rounds of military ammunition to this this person that killed their daughter riddled her body with five bullets and he didn't even ask where it was going. And not only did their case get thrown out of court they were slapped with $200000 in court fees because of the way that the NRA gets its way in our Congress and we take a backseat. It's time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation. Senator Senator excuse me. Senator it is not about rural Senator it was not about rural and urban. Have you ever been to the Eastern Shore? Have you ever been to Western Maryland? We were able to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who live in our rural areas. And we did it by leading with principle not by pandering to the NRA and backing down to the NRA. And I have an F from the NRA Senator. Well maybe that's a healthy thing. ...Anderson when the NRA wrote to everyone in our state when the NRA wrote to members in our state and told people with hunting traditions lies about what our comprehensive gun safety legislation is I wrote right back to them and laid out what it actually did. And that's why not only did we pass it but the NRA didn't... ...dare to petition a referendum... ...Because we built a public consensus... Anderson no president no commander in chief should take the military option off the table even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option. What disturbed people so much about and I would agree with Senator Sanders on this leading us into Iraq under false pretenses and telling us as a people that there were weapons of mass destruction there was was one of the worst blunders in modern American history. But the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls. And I remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion. People were talking at and saying ""it'll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy"" and I thought ""has this world gone mad?"" Whenever we go and contrary to John Quincy Adams' advice ""searching the world for monsters to destroy"" and when we use political might to take a at the expense of democratic principle we hurt ourselves and we hurt our . I believe that as president I would not be so quick to pull for a military tool. I believe that a no-fly zone in Syria at this time actually Secretary would be a mistake. You have to enforce no-fly zones and I believe especially with the Russian air force in the air it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret. I support President Obama. I think we have to play a long game and I think ultimately you want to talk about blunders? I think Assad's invasion of Syria will be seen as a blunder. Anderson I think we are learning... Anderson I think there's lessons to be learned from Benghazi. And those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends. And I believe that's what Chris Stevens was trying to do. But he did not have the tools. We have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in Libya but better decisions in Syria today. And it's a huge national security failing. I believe that nuclear Iran remains the biggest threat along with the threat of ISIL; climate change of course makes cascading threats even more (inaudible). I believe that now that we're finally having debates Anderson that we don't have to be defined by the email scandal and how long what the FBI's asking about. Instead we can talk about affordable college making college debt free and all the issues. Which is why and I see the chair of the DNC here look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table. We need to get wages to go up college more affordable... ...we need to make American 100 percent clean electric by 2050. My name is Martin O'Malley former Mayor of Baltimore former governor of Maryland a life long democrat and most importantly a husband and a father. My wife Katie and I have four great kids Grace and Tara and William and Jack. And like you there is nothing we wouldn't do to give them healthier and better lives. There are some things that I have learned to do better in life than others. And after 15 years of executive experience I have learned how to be an effective leader. Whether it was raising the minimum wage making our public schools the best in America passing marriage equality the DREAM Act and comprehensive gun safety legislation I have learned how to get things done because I am very clear about my principals. Thanks to President Obama our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008. Our country's doing better we are creating jobs again. But we elected a president not a magician and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now. For there is a deep injustice an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart and it will not solve itself. Injustice does not solve itself. What I'm talking about is this our middle class is shrinking. Our poor families are becoming poorer and 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago. We need new leadership and we need action. The sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all American families. Our economy isn't money it's people. It's all of our people and so we must invest in our country and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt. And we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity. The future is what we make of it. We are all in this together. And the question in this election is whether you and I still have the ability to give our kids a better future. I believe we do that is why I am running for president and I need your help. Thank you. Yes actually I believe what she said was that there's a lot of policies that have led to this unrest. But Anderson when I ran for mayor of Baltimore in 1999... Well let's talk about this a little bit. One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38-year low in the year prior to the Freddie Gray's tragic death. Anderson when I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999 it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent addicted and abandoned city in America. And I ran and promised people that together we could turn that around. And we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime or part one (ph) crime by more than any other major city in America over the next 10 years. I did not make our city immune to setbacks. But I attended a lot of funerals including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor African-American neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner. We've saved over a thousand lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together. And the vast majority of them were young and poor and black. It wasn't easy on any day. But we saved lives and we gave our city a better future improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office. Well I think the key word in your followup there was the word ""settle."" That's true. It was settled. Arrests peaked in 2003 Anderson but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime. Look none of this is easy. None of us has all the answers. But together as a city we saved a lot of lives. It was about leadership. It was about principle. And it was about bringing people together. Thank you. And Anderson I also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done. Look it's fine to talk about all of these things and I'm glad we're talking about these things but I've actually done them. We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said. We actually did it. And Anderson here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very very real. Sandy and Lonnie Phillips are here from Colorado. And their daughter Jessie was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora. Now to try to transform their grief they went to court where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court but in this case you want to talk about a a rigged game Senator? The game was rigged. A man had sold 4000 rounds of military ammunition to this this person that killed their daughter riddled her body with five bullets and he didn't even ask where it was going. And not only did their case get thrown out of court they were slapped with $200000 in court fees because of the way that the NRA gets its way in our Congress and we take a backseat. It's time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation. Senator Senator excuse me. Senator it is not about rural Senator it was not about rural and urban. Have you ever been to the Eastern Shore? Have you ever been to Western Maryland? We were able to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who live in our rural areas.

2015-10-13 00:00:00,clinton," Well thank you and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the Democratic debates. I'm Hillary Clinton. I have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady as a senator from New York and as secretary of state. I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child. And every day I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her but for all of our children. I have spent a very long time my entire adult life looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead and in particular to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her God-given potential. I've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning and I've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy by making it possible once again to invest in science and research and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. At the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. Yes of course raise the minimum wage but we have to do so much more including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. And then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. Right now the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. So I have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families. And I want to do more to help us balance family and work. I believe in equal pay for equal work for women but I also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world. During the course of the evening tonight I'll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I've done behind them. But for me this is about bringing our country together again. And I will do everything I can to heal the divides the divides economically because there's too much inequality; the racial divides; the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community so that we work together and yes finally fathers will be able to say to their daughters you too can grow up to be president. Well actually I have been very consistent. Over the course of my entire life I have always fought for the same values and principles but like most human beings including those of us who run for office I do absorb new information. I do look at what's happening in the world. You know take the trade deal. I did say when I was secretary of state three years ago that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week and in looking at it it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new good jobs for Americans for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say ""this will help raise your wages."" And I concluded I could not. No. I think that like most people that I know I have a range of views but they are rooted in my values and my experience. And I don't take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment. You know when I left law school my first job was with the Children's Defense Fund and for all the years since I have been focused on how we're going to un-stack the deck and how we're gonna make it possible for more people to have the experience I had. You know to be able to come from a grandfather who was a factory worker a father who was a small business person and now asking the people of America to elect me president. I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And I know... ...how to find common ground and I know how to stand my ground and I have proved that in every position that I've had even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me honestly. But we found ways to work together on everything from... ...reforming foster care and adoption to the Children's Health Insurance Program which insures... ...8 million kids. So I have a long history of getting things done rooted in the same values... ...I've always had. Well let me just follow-up on that Anderson because when I think about capitalism I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families. And I don't think we should confuse what we have to do every so often in America which is save capitalism from itself. And I think what Senator Sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have. But we are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America. And it's our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesn't run amok and doesn't cause the kind of inequities we're seeing in our economic system. But we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history... ... of the world. No not at all. I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence. This has gone on too long and it's time the entire country stood up against the NRA. The majority of our country... ... supports background checks and even the majority of gun owners do. Senator Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill. Since it was passed more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented. He also did vote as he said for this immunity provision. I voted against it. I was in the Senate at the same time. It wasn't that complicated to me. It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America. Everybody else has to be accountable but not the gun manufacturers. And we need to stand up and say: Enough of that. We're not going to let it continue. Well first of all we got a lot of business done with the Russians when Medvedev was the president and not Putin. We got a nuclear arms deal we got the Iranian sanctions we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in Afghanistan. There's no doubt that when Putin came back in and said he was going to be President that did change the relationship. We have to stand up to his bullying and specifically in Syria it is important and I applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the Russians to make it clear that they've got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict. And to provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of Syria at the rate they are. And I think it's important too that the United States make it very clear to Putin that it's not acceptable for him to be in Syria creating more chaos bombing people on behalf of Assad and we can't do that if we don't take more of a leadership position which is what I'm advocating. ...Well nobody does. Nobody does Senator Sanders. Well I recall very well being on a debate stage I think about 25 times with then Senator Obama debating this very issue. After the election he asked me to become Secretary of State. He valued my judgment and I spent a lot of time with him... ...in the Situation Room going over some very difficult issues. You know I I agree completely. We don't want American troops on the ground in Syria. I never said that. What I said was we had to put together a coalition in fact something that I worked on before I left the State Department to do and yes that it should include Arabs people in the region. Because what I worry about is what will happen with ISIS gaining more territory having more reach and frankly posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond. So I think while you're talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden where I was one of his few advisers or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on Iran I think I have a lot of evidence... Well first of all I... Well I am in the middle here and... Lots of things coming from all directions. You know I have to say I was very pleased when Governor O'Malley endorsed me for president in 2008 and I enjoyed his strong support in that campaign. And I consider him obviously a friend. Let me say because there's a lot of loose talk going on here we are already flying in Syria just as we are flying in Iraq. The president has made a very tough decision. What I believe and why I have advocated that the no-fly zone which of course would be in a coalition be put on the table is because I'm trying to figure out what leverage we have to get Russia to the table. You know diplomacy is not about getting to the perfect solution. It's about how you balance the risks. And I think we have an opportunity here and I know that inside the administration this is being hotly debated to get that leverage to try to get the Russians to have to deal with everybody in the region and begin to move toward a political diplomatic solution in Syria. Well let's remember what was going on. We had a murderous dictator Gadhafi who had American blood on his hands as I'm sure you remember threatening to massacre large numbers of the Libyan people. We had our closest allies in Europe burning up the phone lines begging us to help them try to prevent what they saw as a mass genocide in their words. And we had the Arabs standing by our side saying ""We want you to help us deal with Gadhafi."" Our response which I think was smart power at its best is that the United States will not lead this. We will provide essential unique capabilities that we have but the Europeans and the Arabs had to be first over the line. We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya. And I'll say this for the Libyan people... But let I'll get to that. But I think it's important since I understand Senator Webb's very strong feelings about this to explain where we were then and to point out that I think President Obama made the right decision at the time. And the Libyan people had a free election the first time since 1951. And you know what they voted for moderates they voted with the hope of democracy. Because of the Arab Spring because of a lot of other things there was turmoil to be followed. But unless you believe the United States should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous which I do not then when we send them forth there is always the potential for danger and risk. I I think it has to be continued threat from the spread of nuclear weapons nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hands. I know the terrorists are constantly seeking it and that's why we have to stay vigilant but also united around the world to prevent that. Well I've taken responsibility for it. I did say it was a mistake. What I did was allowed by the State Department but it wasn't the best choice. And I have been as transparent as I know to be turning over 55000 pages of my e-mails asking that they be made public. And you're right. I am going to be testifying. I've been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public which was not originally agreed to. But let's just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee. It is a partisan vehicle as admitted by the House Republican majority leader Mr. McCarthy to drive down my poll numbers. Big surprise. And that's what they have attempted to do. I am still standing. I am happy to be part of this debate. And I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people. You know I believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about like how are we going to make college affordable? How are we going to pay down student debt? How are we going to get health care for everybody... Well I never said it wasn't legitimate. I said that I have answered all the questions and I will certainly be doing so again before this committee. But I think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture. This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi wouldn't happen again. There were already seven committee reports about what to do. So I think it's pretty clear what their obvious goal is. But I'll be there. I'll answer their questions. But tonight I want to talk not about my e-mails but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States. Thank you. Me too. Me too. Thank you Bernie. Thank you. No. Well thank you and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the Democratic debates. I'm Hillary Clinton. I have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady as a senator from New York and as secretary of state.

I know the terrorists are constantly seeking it and that's why we have to stay vigilant but also united around the world to prevent that. Well I've taken responsibility for it. I did say it was a mistake. What I did was allowed by the State Department but it wasn't the best choice. And I have been as transparent as I know to be turning over 55000 pages of my e-mails asking that they be made public. And you're right. I am going to be testifying. I've been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public which was not originally agreed to. But let's just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee. It is a partisan vehicle as admitted by the House Republican majority leader Mr. McCarthy to drive down my poll numbers. Big surprise. And that's what they have attempted to do. I am still standing. I am happy to be part of this debate. And I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people. You know I believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about like how are we going to make college affordable? How are we going to pay down student debt? How are we going to get health care for everybody... Well I never said it wasn't legitimate. I said that I have answered all the questions and I will certainly be doing so again before this committee. But I think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture. This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi wouldn't happen again. There were already seven committee reports about what to do. So I think it's pretty clear what their obvious goal is. But I'll be there. I'll answer their questions. But tonight I want to talk not about my e-mails but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States. Thank you. Me too. Me too. Thank you Bernie. Thank you. No."

I'm not sure how to follow that but this question is about something that has tripped some of the candidates up out on the campaign trail. Can you hear me? Can't hear me in the room.

2015-10-13 00:00:00,bash, Governor Chafee you were the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the Iraq war. You say Secretary Clinton should be disqualified from the presidency because she voted in favor of using force in Iraq. She has since said that her vote was a mistake. Why isn't that good enough? Secretary Clinton he's questioning your judgment. Senator Sanders Senator Sanders I want to bring you in here. My question for you is as a congressman you voted against the Iraq War. You voted against the Gulf War. You're just talking about Syria but under what circumstances would a President Sanders actually use force? All right.

2016-02-06 00:00:00,raddatz," Questions of leadership and character have dominated the news ever since the Iowa caucuses a few days ago. Here with us to question the candidates this evening are Josh McElveen from WMUR here in Manchester and author and commentator Mary Katherine Ham. Dr. Ben Carson. Businessman Donald Trump. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Ladies and gentlemen the Republican candidates. And Donald Trump. The applause so loud you couldn't hear. We couldn't hear either. That's a good sign for the excitement this evening. Gentlemen thank you for being here tonight just days before voters here in New Hampshire make their decisions. The rules are simple and have been agreed to by all the campaigns. There will be 60 seconds to answer and if another candidate is mentioned in that answer that candidate will have 30 seconds to respond. There are green yellow and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is up and they will also hear this sound. Senator Cruz you are a first term Senator as well. Your opponents say you like Senator Rubio are not prepared to be Commander in Chief. You have talked tough about threats we face in the Mid-East. It was reported just moments ago that the North Koreans test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea has nuclear weapons and conducted another nuclear test just last month. The missile that was launched is the kind the North Koreans hope could someday carry a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States. How would you respond if Commander in Chief to that launch? Well let me ask you this if you were Commander in Chief tonight would you have order the U.S. military to destroy that missile preemptively on the launchpad to prevent North Korea from becoming an even graver threat? ... Senator Cruz let me tell you this you have talked tough about the Mid-East you haven't gotten those intelligence briefings about that. Why not tell us whether you would preemptively strike a missile on a launchpad that threatens the U.S... Okay. Senator Cruz I will say that missile has been sitting there for quite some time and they have had eyes on it. Senator Rubio I'm talking about a preemptive strike on the launch pad. OK. Thank you Senator Rubio. Governor Kasich how would you respond to tonight's launch? Thank you Governor Kasich. Thank you thank you... ... Governor Bush I'll get to you in a moment. Thank you Governor Bush. Mr. Trump do you have a red line with North Korea? Would you consider military action? And how far would you let them go? And I'd like him to finish the question please. Specific as to North Korea. Senator Rubio you were mentioned. Thank you very much Senator Rubio. Governor Bush another problem facing the commander-in-chief right now is that North Korea is currently detaining an American college student. What would you do to get that college student back home? Governor Christie I want to go to you on the same question. Would you negotiate with North Korea to... Thank you very much Governor Christie. David? Senator Cruz to that point Mr. Trump has said that your position on health care means that maybe you've got quote ""no heart"". There is a question here though about uncovered folks. You suggested repealing and replacing Obamacare. As we learned with President Obama's broken promise that everyone could keep their plan any major plan change in health care policy carries with it the risk that some people will lose their insurance coverage or have to change it. How do you reassure that those people that repealing and replacing Obamacare is still in their best interest?

2016-02-06 00:00:00,muir," Good evening again everyone. This is the first time since Iowa and the only time before the New Hampshire primary that the Republican candidates will have the opportunity to face each other. The people of Iowa have been heard. Now it's New Hampshire's turn. In just three days voters here will decide who they think should be the Republican nominee for president. So let's welcome the candidates for the Republican nomination for president. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Florida Senator Marco Rubio. And Ohio Governor John Kasich. And Dr. Ben Carson please come out on the stage. He's standing there as well. Dr. Carson. And lastly we welcome back to the debate stage Donald Trump. It was so noisy in here. Yes. Yes. We're going to introduce Ohio Governor John kasich. The applause so loud here in the hall. So let's get started. We welcome you all to the debate stage here tonight. We're going to tackle the issues Americans are most concerned about the economy ISIS Homeland Security. And here in New Hampshire some of the most heated rhetoric yet over who is best suited to step in on day one who has the experience who has the temperament to be commander-in-chief. Mr. Trump Senator Cruz has said about you right here in New Hampshire this week quote ""I don't know anyone who would be comfortable with someone who behaves this way having his finger on the button. We're liable to wake up one morning and if he were president he would nuke Denmark."" Saying quote ""That's temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.""I wanted to give you the opportunity to respond to this and to tell the American people tonight why you do have the temperament to be commander-in-chief. Mr. Trump thank you. I want to bring this to Senator Cruz then. Because Senator you did said of Trump's behavior this week that's not the temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.Why not? Senator Cruz I did ask about Mr. Trump. You said he doesn't have the temperament to be commander-in-chief. Do you stand by those words? Senator Cruz thank you. We're going to continue on this notion of readiness and experience. I'm going to come back. If you would like to respond Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump thank you. And we're going to continue on this notion of readiness and on experience but I want to ask about a headline that was back in the papers again this morning. Dr. Carson on the day of the Iowa caucuses the Cruz campaign sent out messages and voicemails saying quote ""Breaking news. Dr. Ben Carson will be planning to suspend his campaign following tonight's caucuses. Please inform any Carson caucus-goers of this news.""But as we can all see you are still standing here tonight. Late this week your campaign sent this e-mail quote ""This kind of deceitful behavior is why the American people don't trust politicians. If Senator Cruz does not act then he clearly represents D.C. values.""What kind of action do you think Senator Cruz should take? Senator Cruz. Dr. Carson thank you.Senator Cruz you have said that Dr. Carson and his wife have become friends of yours. I'm curious as why you didn't call ahead of time to either the doctor or his wife or have your campaign check in with the other campaign before sending out those messages. Senator Cruz thank you. We're going to move on here. Back to the issues... Dr. Carson please. Dr. Carson thank you. Thank you doctor. Senator Rubio. I want to stay on the issue of readiness to be president and experience and questions about you being a first-term senator.Governor Christie warning voters here in New Hampshire against voting for another first-term senator as America did with Barack Obama in 2008. Arguing that you are quote "" not ready to be president of the United States.""And Senator Santorum who we all know dropped out of the race and endorsed you had a hard time when asked on national television listing your accomplishments as senator. Tonight what are your accomplishments in the Senate that demonstrate you are ready to be president of the United States? Senator Rubio thank you. I do want to ask Governor Christie Governor Christie you said fool me once shame on you; fool me twice shame on me when it comes to electing a first-term senator. You heard Senator Rubio make the case that he does have the experience. Your response? Governor thank you. Senator Rubio? Senator Rubio thank you. I want to bring in governor bush on this because you... ... have made this... If you'd like to respond to economic... Senator Rubio? Governor Christie we will we will... Governor Christie thank you Governor. I will mention listen... ... Listen people... Governor Bush I'll mention your name so that you can come in on this... I want to bring you in on this because you've made this central to your campaign right here in New Hampshire in the last couple of days. Four Years ago you said of Senator Rubio he was ready to be Vice President. You spoke of his experience as well. You said he has the fortitude to be a good President but just this week you said Senator Rubio accomplished quote ""nothing"" in the Senate. How do you square the two? ... We're going to continue with leadership now. Martha? Martha we're going to turn to immigration now. And I want to bring in Governor Kasich because you told us in an ABC interview Governor quote ""It is completely ridiculous to think we are going to go into neighborhoods grab people out of their homes and ship people back to Mexico."" Adding quote ""That's not where the party is. The party is not for departing 11.5 million people."" But Mr. Trump and Senator Cruz who have made deportation central to their campaigns top the national polls. So my question for you are you not where the voters are? Governor Kasich thank you. I want to bring this next to Senator Cruz. You heard what the governor said. He said ""We need practical solutions."" And you've said ""I don't intend to send jack boots to knock on doors. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime.""So what is your plan? How will you deport 11.5 million undocumented people? And be specific. How would you do it? Let me just ask you this though because Governor Kasich was talking about the families and what you do with the families that you would have to send home. Can you tell the American people tonight how you would do that? Senator Cruz thank you. I want to bring in Senator Rubio. This question is about immigration it is also about leadership. You're aware of the criticism from many candidates on this stage tonight that you co-authored the so-called Gang of Eight bill that would have created a path to citizenship for people here illegally.Governor Christie has said of you as soon as you felt the heat you turned tail and run. Governor Bush has said ""I don't think we need people cutting and running anymore.""Did you fight for your own legislation Senator or did you run from it? But I'm asking did you fight for the legislation at the time or did you run from it as you're... Governor Christie? Governor thank you. Senator Rubio? Senator Rubio thank you. We want to turn to health care in this country and for that author and commentator Mary Katherine Ham tonight. Mary Katherine thank you. We want to turn now to the issue of eminent domain which is being debated right here in New Hampshire. And Josh McElveen is the political director and the anchor of WMUR TV. Josh? Josh thank you. When we come back here tonight jobs ISIS and what it means to be a conservative. The Republican debate continues right here from New Hampshire on ABC. We'll be right back. And we welcome you back to the Republican debate from New Hampshire tonight here on ABC. We're going to turn now to what it means to be a conservative and I want to turn to Governor Kasich. Governor while campaigning here in New Hampshire you were already asked about groans from some conservatives after your endorsements from the New York Times and the Boston Globe. You said quote ""What conservatives have to know is they have to say look isn't it nice to have a conservative like me liked? And maybe the ought to think about it because if I get elected president the Republican party and the definition of conservatism is going to change.""How would you change conservatism? Governor Kasich thank you. Mr. Trump you've heard the argument from many of the candidates on this stage that you're not a true conservative. Tell the voters watching tonight why you are. Mr. Trump thank you. Senator Rubio you have said yourself that you don't think Donald Trump is running as a conservative. Did he convince you? Senator Rubio thank you. I want to turn this discussion to the economy now. And Mr. Trump Governor Christie has said ""I tell everybody who goes to a Donald Trump event if you get to ask a question just ask him how."" Christie said ""I don't care which of the things he talks about just ask him how."" You have said that you'd be the greatest jobs president God ever created. Tell Americans watching tonight how many jobs you would create in the first term and how. Mr. Trump thank you. There are a lot of governors on this stage tonight and Governor Christie Governor Kasich said of you quote ""In Ohio we balanced a budget. They don't have one over in New Jersey. Our credit has been strengthened. Their credit has been downgraded. We've got more jobs.""How important are those metrics in choosing the next president? And is his job is his record on jobs I should say actually stronger than yours? So let's welcome the candidates for the Republican nomination for president. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Florida Senator Marco Rubio. And Ohio Governor John Kasich. And Dr. Ben Carson please come out on the stage. He's standing there as well. Dr. Carson.

2016-02-06 00:00:00,christie," What about Kasich? Can I introduce Kasich? Sure. First let's remember something. Every morning when a United States senator wakes up they think about what kind of speech can I give or what kind of bill can I drop? Every morning when I wake up I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me? It's a different experience it's a much different experience. And the fact is Marco you shouldn't compare yourself to Joe Biden and you shouldn't say that that's what we're doing. Here is exactly what we're doing.You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply haven't. And the fact is the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did you weren't even there to vote for it. That's not leadership that's truancy. And the fact is that what we need to do what we need to have in this country is not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges don't come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.I like Marco Rubio and he's a smart person and a good guy but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. We've watched it happen everybody. For the last seven years the people of New Hampshire are smart. Do not make the same mistake again. Hold on one second. Excuse me... I think he mentioned me and my record in there so I think I get a chance to respond. You see everybody I want the people at home to think about this. That's what Washington D.C. Does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him. See Marco Marco the thing is this. When you're president of the United States when you're a governor of a state the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn't solve one problem for one person. They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open. And when the worst natural disaster in your state's history hits you they expect you to rebuild their state which is what I've done.None of that stuff happens on the floor of the United States Senate. It's a fine job I'm glad you ran for it but it does not prepare you for president of the United States. There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is everybody. You know what the shame is you know what the shame is Marco? The shame is that you would actually criticize somebody for showing up to work plowing the streets getting the trains running back on time when you've never been responsible for that in your entire life. And the fact is I went back it got done and here's... Oh so wait a second. Is that one of the skills you get as a United States senator ESP also? Because I don't think it is. It gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points. Let's get something... No. Let's make something very clear. I learned seven years as a federal prosecutor in dealing with types of situations like we're talking about in North Korea where criminals take people hostage. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Ever. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Everyone out at home watching tonight understands that principle. And so what you need to do is to engage in a much different way with these folks. They do not understand anything but toughness and strength and we need to engage the Chinese to deal with the North Koreans but we also need to make sure that they understand there's a commander-in-chief who will not pay ransom for any hostage.This president and his former secretary of State are for paying ransom for hostages. When do that you endanger even more Americans around the world to be the subject of this type of hostage taking and illegal detention. You need a strong commander-in-chief who will look these folks in the eye and say we will not put up with this and we will take whatever actions we need to take not only to get our people home safely but to swiftly and surely punish those who believe they can violate the law and violate American's sovereign rights to travel the world freely and safely.This is unacceptable. And this is why this president is so weak and why the secretary of State who is embracing a third Barack Obama term would be even weaker. Yeah David I would just like you to listen again everybody. This is the difference between being a governor who actually has to be responsible for problems and not answering a question. The question was ""Did he fight for his legislation?"" It's abundantly clear that he didn't. It's abundantly clear that he didn't fight for the legislation.When the teachers unions attacked me with $20 million of ads because I wanted to reform teacher tenure I fought them and fought them and fought them and I won.When they didn't want when people wanted to raise taxes in my state at Democratic legislature and threatened to close down the government I told them fine. Close down the government. I'll get in my cars head to the governor's mansion order a pizza open a beer and watch the Mets. You can call me when the government reopens.And guess what they didn't do? They didn't pass a tax increase because I vetoed it and they never closed the government because they knew I would fight for what I believed in. The fact of the matter is a leader must fight for what they believe in. Not handicap it and say well maybe since I can't win this one I'll run. That's not what leadership is. That's what Congress is. Good evening. Well he deserves credit ge tonight and Governor Christie Governor Kasich said of you quote ""In Ohio we balanced a budget. They don't have one over in New Jersey. Our credit has been strengthened. Their credit has been downgraded. We've got more jobs."" How important are those metrics in choosing the next president? And is his job is his record on jobs I should say actually stronger than yours? Well he deserves credit a have been heard. Now it's New Hampshire's turn. In just three days voters here will decide who they think should be the Republican nominee for president. What about Kasich? Can I introduce Kasich? Sure. First let's remember something. Every morning when a United States senator wakes up they think about what kind of speech can I give or what kind of bill can I drop? Every morning when I wake up I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me? It's a different experience it's a much different experience. And the fact is Marco you shouldn't compare yourself to Joe Biden and you shouldn't say that that's what we're doing. Here is exactly what we're doing.You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply haven't. And the fact is the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did you weren't even there to vote for it. That's not leadership that's truancy. And the fact is that what we need to do what we need to have in this country is not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges don't come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.I like Marco Rubio and he's a smart person and a good guy but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. We've watched it happen everybody. For the last seven years the people of New Hampshire are smart. Do not make the same mistake again. Hold on one second. Excuse me... I think he mentioned me and my record in there so I think I get a chance to respond. You see everybody I want the people at home to think about this. That's what Washington D.C. Does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him. See Marco Marco the thing is this. When you're president of the United States when you're a governor of a state the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn't solve one problem for one person. They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open. And when the worst natural disaster in your state's history hits you they expect you to rebuild their state which is what I've done.None of that stuff happens on the floor of the United States Senate. It's a fine job I'm glad you ran for it but it does not prepare you for president of the United States. There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is everybody. You know what the shame is you know what the shame is Marco? The shame is that you would actually criticize somebody for showing up to work plowing the streets getting the trains running back on time when you've never been responsible for that in your entire life. And the fact is I went back it got done and here's... Oh so wait a second. Is that one of the skills you get as a United States senator ESP also? Because I don't think it is. It gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points. Let's get something... No. Let's make something very clear. I learned seven years as a federal prosecutor in dealing with types of situations like we're talking about in North Korea where criminals take people hostage. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Ever. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Everyone out at home watching tonight understands that principle. And so what you need to do is to engage in a much different way with these folks. They do not understand anything but toughness and strength and we need to engage the Chinese to deal with the North Koreans but we also need to make sure that they understand there's a commander-in-chief who will not pay ransom for any hostage.This president and his former secretary of State are for paying ransom for hostages. When do that you endanger even more Americans around the world to be the subject of this type of hostage taking and illegal detention. You need a strong commander-in-chief who will look these folks in the eye and say we will not put up with this and we will take whatever actions we need to take not only to get our people home safely but to swiftly and surely punish those who believe they can violate the law and violate American's sovereign rights to travel the world freely and safely.This is unacceptable. And this is why this president is so weak and why the secretary of State who is embracing a third Barack Obama term would be even weaker. Yeah David I would just like you to listen again everybody. This is the difference between being a governor who actually has to be responsible for problems and not answering a question. The question was ""Did he fight for his legislation?"" It's abundantly clear that he didn't. It's abundantly clear that he didn't fight for the legislation.When the teachers unions attacked me with $20 million of ads because I wanted to reform teacher tenure I fought them and fought them and fought them and I won.When they didn't want when people wanted to raise taxes in my state at Democratic legislature and threatened to close down the government I told them fine. Close down the government. I'll get in my cars head to the governor's mansion order a pizza open a beer and watch the Mets. You can call me when the government reopens.And guess what they didn't do? They didn't pass a tax increase because I vetoed it and they never closed the government because they knew I would fight for what I believed in. The fact of the matter is a leader must fight for what they believe in. Not handicap it and say well maybe since I can't win this one I'll run. That's not what leadership is. That's what Congress is. Good evening."
2016-02-06 00:00:00,rubio, Well let me say from protecting the people of Florida from imminent domain abuse to bringing accountability to the V.A. to the Girls Count Act to sanctioning groups I'm proud of my service in the United States Senate and before that in the Florida legislature. I will say if politics becomes and the presidency becomes about electing people who have been Congress or in the Senate the longest we should all rally around Joe Biden. He's been around 1000 years. He's passed hundreds of bills and I don't think any of us believe Joe Biden should be president of the United States.And let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country to make America more like the rest of the world.That's why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When I'm president of the United States we are going to re-embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the history of the world. If I may respond to that. Well I think the experience is not just what you did but how it worked out. Under Chris Christie's governorship of New Jersey they've been downgraded nine times in their credit rating. This country already has a debt problem we don't need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and destroying the credit rating of his state. But I would add this. Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world we want to be the United States of America. And when I'm elected president this will become once again the single greatest nation in the history of the world not the disaster Barack Obama has imposed upon us. Chris Chris your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago. You didn't even want to go back. They had to shame you into going back. And then you stayed there for 36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign. Those are the facts. Here's the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he's doing. Well that's the that's the reason why this campaign is so important. Because I think this notion I think this is an important point. We have to understand what we're going through here. We are not facing a president that doesn't know what he's doing. He knows what he is doing. That's why he's done the things he's done. That's why we have a president that passed Obamacare and the stimulus. All this damage that he's done to America is deliberate. This is a president that's trying to redefine this country. That's why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation as a people. Our future is at stake.This election is not about the past. It is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century and if we elect someone like Barack Obama a Hillary Clinton a Bernie Sanders or anyone like that our children are going to be the first Americans to inherit a diminishes country. That will not happen if I'm elected. Chris you didn't want to go back. You didn't want to go back. You didn't want to go back Chris. Chris everybody you said you weren't going to go back. He told everyone he wasn't going to go back. They had to shame him into going back. And when he decided to go back he criticized the young lady saying what am I supposed to do go back with a mop and clean up the flooding? ... It's your record it's not a talking point... But Martha just Martha just to clarify on that point because he's right and one more thing to point it is standard procedure of the United States to shoot down those missiles once launched if they pose a threat to civilians land and ships. Well no I understand. And not but but I think it's important to note that it is and Senator Cruz I think was alluding to this as well it is the standard procedure of the United States if those missiles pose a threat to land civilians our allies or any of our assets to shoot down that missile in mid-flight. I understand your question was about a preemptive strike but my point is that there is in place now contingencies to avoid any sort of that strike from going errant and destroying any any assets of the United States or implicating or hurting any of our allies or any of our assets in the region. Yeah. I have a I got mentioned can I respond? Here's the broader point as well and then I think it touches on what Donald just mentioned. Barack Obama views America as this arrogant global power that needed to be cut down to size. OK? This is a president that views this country as a country that's been too powerful in the world and we create problems around the world.For example it's one of the reasons why he had betrayed Israel because he believes that if we create separation from Israel it will help our relations in the Islamic world. The same is happening in the Asia-Pacific region with accommodations to North Korea. North Korean should be back on that list of terrorist nations as an example.And Donald's absolutely right. China does have a lot of influence over North Korea and he should be leveraging our relationship with the Chinese to ensure that North Korea no longer has access to the resources that have allowed them a country that has no economy to develop long range missiles already capable of reaching the west coast of the United States potentially. Here's the bottom line. We can't get that legislation passed. The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first and you prove it to them. This has been abundantly clear. Every effort over the last ten years to do those comprehensively has failed. And it has failed because the American people have zero trust that the federal government will enforce our laws.And that's why since then I have said repeatedly if you are serious about immigration reform then the key that unlocks the door to being able to do that is not just to pass a law that says it is going to enforce the law but to actually do it. To hire the 20000 new border agents to finish the fencing and walls to put in place mandatory e-verify to put in place an entry-exit tracking system to prevent visa overstays.And once that is in place and that's working I believe the American people will support a very reasonable but responsible approach to people that have been here a long time who are not dangerous criminals who pay taxes and pay fines for what they did.But until then none of that is going to be possible. Well the legislation passed but it has no support. In essence it couldn't pass in the House it will never pass in the United States until we secure the border and it is not the way we're going to do when I'm president. When I'm president we are going to enforce the law first prove to people that illegal immigration is under control. And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support when it comes to people that are not criminals who have been in the this country for a long time and who otherwise would like to stay. Leadership is ultimately about solving the problem. And the approach that was tried and has been tried now repeatedly over ten years to do this comprehensively all at once in a massive piece of legislation has no chance of passage. It is not leadership to continue to try something that has no chance of happening. I want to make progress on this issue. It has been discussed now for 30 years and nothing ever happens.And I am telling you that the only way forward on this issue that has any chance of happening meaning gaining the support of the American people you cannot do this without the support of the American people is an approach that begins by proving that once and for all illegal immigration is under control. Good evening. Well I think conservatism is about three things and Donald touched on one of them but it's about three things. The first is conservatism is about limited government especially at the federal level. The federal government is a limited government limited by the Constitution which delineates its powers. If it's not in the Constitution it does not belong to the federal government. It belongs to states local communities and the private sector. It's about free enterprise which is an economic model that allows everyone to rise without pulling anyone down. The reason why free enterprise is the greatest economic model in the history of the world is because it's the only economic model where you can make poor people richer without making rich people poor.And it's about a strong national defense. It's about believing unlike Barack Obama that the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet. That's conservatism. Well let me say from protecting the people of Florida from imminent domain abuse to bringing accountability to the V.A. to the Girls Count Act to sanctioning groups I'm proud of my service in the United States Senate and before that in the Florida legislature. I will say if politics becomes and the presidency becomes about electing people who have been Congress or in the Senate the longest we should all rally around Joe Biden. He's been around 1000 years.

2016-02-06 00:00:00,trump," I actually think I have the best temperament. I built a massive corporation. I employ thousands and thousands of people. I've gotten along with people for years and years have tremendous relationships with many people including politicians on both sides. And no matter how you cut it when I when I came out I hit immigration I hit it very hard. Everybody said ""Oh the temperament"" because I talked about illegal immigration. Now everybody's coming to me they're all trying to say well he's right we have to come to him. I hit other things. I talked about Muslims. We have a problem. Nobody else wanted to mention the problem I brought it up. I took a lot of heat. We have to have a temporary something because there's something going on that's not good. And remember this I'm the only one up here when the war of Iraq in Iraq I was the one that said ""Don't go don't do it you're going to destabilize the Middle East."" So I'm not one with a trigger. I'm not one with a trigger. Other people up here believe me would be a lot faster.But I'll build the mill arbitrary stronger bigger better than anybody up here and nobody is going to mess with us. That I can tell you. Am I allowed to respond? I have to respond. First of all I respect what Ted just said but if you noticed he didn't answer your question. And that's what's going to happen OK. That's what's going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against. We're going to win with Trump. We're going to win. We don't win anymore. Our country doesn't win anymore. We're going to win with Trump. And people back down with Trump. And that's what I like and that's what the country is going to like. Well let me say a couple of things. First of all Marco said earlier on that President Obama knows exactly what he's doing like we have this president that really knows. I disagree respectfully with Marco. I think we have a president who as a president is totally incompetent and he doesn't know what he's doing. I think he has no idea what he's doing. And our country is going to hell. So I just want to say we disagree on that. Is that okay? Good. As to North Korea? We have tremendous has been just sucked out of our country by China. China says they don't have that good of control over North Korea. They have tremendous control. I deal with the Chinese all of the time. I do tremendous the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in Manhattan. I deal with them. They tell me. They have total absolute control practically of North Korea. They are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country they're rebuilding China with the money they take out of our country. I would get on with China let China solve that problem. They can do it quickly and surgically. That's what we should do with North Korea. Good evening. Yes. I don't think I am. I think I'm closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare. We're going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better. And there are so many examples of it. And I will tell you part of the reason we have some people laughing because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here.I am self-funded. The only one they're not taking care of is me. We have our lines around each state. The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare. The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health. We are going to end that.We're going to take out the artificial boundaries the artificial lines. We're going to get a plan where people compete free enterprise. They compete. So much better. In addition to that you have the health care savings plans which are excellent. What I do say is there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican I don't want that to happen. We're going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we're going to take care of those people.And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree... ...you're not going to let people die sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country. Well let me just tell you about eminent domain because almost all of these people actually criticize it but so many people have hit me with commercials and other things about eminent domain. Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country for our country. Without it you wouldn't have roads you wouldn't have hospitals you wouldn't have anything. You wouldn't have schools you wouldn't have bridges. You need eminent domain. And a lot of the big conservatives that tell me how conservative they are I think I'm more than they are they tell me oh well they all want the Keystone Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline without eminent domain it wouldn't go 10 feet OK? You need eminent domain. And eminent domain is a good thing not a bad thing.And what a lot of people don't know because they were all saying oh you're going to take their property. When somebody when eminent domain is used on somebody's property that person gets a fortune. They get at least fair market value and if they are smart they'll get two or three times the value of their property. But without eminent domain you don't have roads highways schools bridges or anything.So eminent domain it's not that I love it but eminent domain is absolutely it's a necessity for a country. And certainly it's a necessity for our country. Yes. Jeb wants to be he wants to be a tough guy tonight. I didn't take the property. I didn't take the property. The woman ultimately didn't want to do that. I walked away. Well let me just you know he wants to be a tough guy. A lot of times you'll have you'll have and it didn't work very well. A lot of time let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times a lot of times... ... you let me talk. Let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times... ...that's all of his donors and special interests out there. So it's what it is. That's what and by the way let me just tell you we needed tickets. You can't get them. You know who has the tickets for the I'm talking about to the television audience? Donors special interests the people that are putting up the money. That's who it is. The RNC told us. We have all donors in the audience. And the reason they're not loving me... ...the reason they're not excuse me. The reason they're not loving me is I don't want their money. I'm going to do the right thing for the American public. I don't want their money. I don't need their money. And I'm the only one up here that can say that.Eminent domain the Keystone pipeline do you consider that a private job? Do you do you consider that... No no let me ask you Jeb. Do you consider the Keystone pipeline private? Is it public or private? Real a public use? No it's a private job. It's a private job. You wouldn't have the Keystone pipeline that you want so badly without eminent domain. You wouldn't have massive excuse me Josh you wouldn't have massive factories without eminent domain. Well I think I am and to me I view the word conservative as a derivative I of of the word conserve. We want to converse our money. We want to conserve our wealth. We want to conserve. We want to be smart. We want to be smart where we go where we spend how we spend. We want to conserve our country. We want to save our country. And we have people that have no idea how to do that and they are not doing it and it's a very important word and it's something I believe in very very strongly. Well before I go there I will tell you I will bring jobs back from China. I will bring jobs back from Japan. I will bring jobs back from Mexico where New Hampshire by the way has been virtually wiped out. They've lost so many businesses going to Mexico because of horrible trade deals. And now we're about to sign another trade deal TPP which is going to be a disaster for this country because they don't talk about monetary manipulation. It is going to be a disaster. I'm going to bring jobs back and I'll start bringing them back very fast. Under my tax plan right now we're the highest taxed country in the world. Under my plan we cut not only taxes for the middle class but we cut taxes for corporations. We will bring back trillions of dollars that's offshore. Right now they have $2.5 trillion and in my opinion it's much more than that. That's what the government says. All of that money is going to come back.And we're not going to lose Pfizer which is now leaving and other great companies which is now leaving. And they're all leaving. We have many many companies that are leaving this country. We're not going to lose them anymore because we're going to have a tax structure that is going to keep them in our country. I actually think I have the best temperament. I built a massive corporation. I employ thousands and thousands of people. I've gotten along with people for years and years have tremendous relationships with many people including politicians on both sides. And no matter how you cut it when I when I came out I hit immigration I hit it very hard. Everybody said ""Oh the temperament"" because I talked about illegal immigration. Now everybody's coming to me they're all trying to say well he's right we have to come to him. I hit other things. I talked about Muslims. We have a problem. Nobody else wanted to mention the problem I brought it up. I took a lot of heat. We have to have a temporary something because there's something going on that's not good. And remember this I'm the only one up here when the war of Iraq in Iraq I was the one that said ""Don't go don't do it you're going to destabilize the Middle East."" So I'm not one with a trigger. I'm not one with a trigger. Other people up here believe me would be a lot faster.But I'll build the mill arbitrary stronger bigger better than anybody up here and nobody is going to mess with us. That I can tell you. Am I allowed to respond? I have to respond. First of all I respect what Ted just said but if you noticed he didn't answer your question. And that's what's going to happen OK. That's what's going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against. We're going to win with Trump. We're going to win. We don't win anymore. Our country doesn't win anymore. We're going to win with Trump. And people back down with Trump. And that's what I like and that's what the country is going to like. Well let me say a couple of things. First of all Marco said earlier on that President Obama knows exactly what he's doing like we have this president that really knows. I disagree respectfully with Marco. I think we have a president who as a president is totally incompetent and he doesn't know what he's doing. I think he has no idea what he's doing. And our country is going to hell. So I just want to say we disagree on that. Is that okay? Good. As to North Korea? We have tremendous has been just sucked out of our country by China. China says they don't have that good of control over North Korea. They have tremendous control. I deal with the Chinese all of the time. I do tremendous the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in Manhattan. I deal with them. They tell me. They have total absolute control practically of North Korea. They are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country they're rebuilding China with the money they take out of our country. I would get on with China let China solve that problem. They can do it quickly and surgically. That's what we should do with North Korea. Good evening. Yes. I don't think I am. I think I'm closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare. We're going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better. And there are so many examples of it. And I will tell you part of the reason we have some people laughing because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here.I am self-funded. The only one they're not taking care of is me. We have our lines around each state. The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare. The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health. We are going to end that.We're going to take out the artificial boundaries the artificial lines. We're going to get a plan where people compete free enterprise. They compete. So much better. In addition to that you have the health care savings plans which are excellent. What I do say is there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican I don't want that to happen. We're going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we're going to take care of those people.And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree... ...you're not going to let people die sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country. Well let me just tell you about eminent domain because almost all of these people actually criticize it but so many people have hit me with commercials and other things about eminent domain. Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country for our country. Without it you wouldn't have roads you wouldn't have hospitals you wouldn't have anything. You wouldn't have schools you wouldn't have bridges. You need eminent domain. And a lot of the big conservatives that tell me how conservative they are I think I'm more than they are they tell me oh well they all want the Keystone Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline without eminent domain it wouldn't go 10 feet OK? You need eminent domain. And eminent domain is a good thing not a bad thing.And what a lot of people don't know because they were all saying oh you're going to take their property. When somebody when eminent domain is used on somebody's property that person gets a fortune. They get at least fair market value and if they are smart they'll get two or three times the value of their property. But without eminent domain you don't have roads highways schools bridges or anything.So eminent domain it's not that I love it but eminent domain is absolutely it's a necessity for a country. And certainly it's a necessity for our country. Yes. Jeb wants to be he wants to be a tough guy tonight. I didn't take the property. I didn't take the property. The woman ultimately didn't want to do that. I walked away. Well let me just you know he wants to be a tough guy. A lot of times you'll have you'll have and it didn't work very well. A lot of time let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times a lot of times... ... you let me talk. Let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times... ...that's all of his donors and special interests out there. So it's what it is. That's what and by the way let me just tell you we needed tickets. You can't get them. You know who has the tickets for the I'm talking about to the television audience? Donors special interests the people that are putting up the money. That's who it is. The RNC told us. We have all donors in the audience. And the reason they're not loving me... ...the reason they're not excuse me. The reason they're not loving me is I don't want their money. I'm going to do the right thing for the American public. I don't want their money. I don't need their money. And I'm the only one up here that can say that.Eminent domain the Keystone pipeline do you consider that a private job? Do you do you consider that... No no let me ask you Jeb. Do you consider the Keystone pipeline private? Is it public or private? Real a public use? No it's a private job. It's a private job. You wouldn't have the Keystone pipeline that you want so badly without eminent domain. You wouldn't have massive excuse me Josh you wouldn't have massive factories without eminent domain. Well I think I am and to me I view the word conservative as a derivative I of of the word conserve. We want to converse our money. We want to conserve our wealth. We want to conserve. We want to be smart. We want to be smart where we go where we spend how we spend. We want to conserve our country. We want to save our country. And we have people that have no idea how to do that and they are not doing it and it's a very important word and it's something I believe in very very strongly. Well before I go there I will tell you I will bring jobs back from China. I will bring jobs back from Japan. I will bring jobs back from Mexico where New Hampshire by the way has been virtually wiped out. They've lost so many businesses going to Mexico because of horrible trade deals. And now we're about to sign another trade deal TPP which is going to be a disaster for this country because they don't talk about monetary manipulation. It is going to be a disaster. I'm going to bring jobs back and I'll start bringing them back very fast. Under my tax plan right now we're the highest taxed country in the world. Under my plan we cut not only taxes for the middle class but we cut taxes for corporations. We will bring back trillions of dollars that's offshore. Right now they have $2.5 trillion and in my opinion it's much more than that. That's what the government says. All of that money is going to come back.And we're not going to lose Pfizer which is now leaving and other great companies which is now leaving. And they're all leaving. We have many many companies that are leaving this country. We're not going to lose them anymore because we're going to have a tax structure that is going to keep them in our country."
2016-02-06 00:00:00,carson," Well you know when I wasn't introduced No. 2 as was the plan I thought maybe he thought I already had dropped out. But... But you know today is the 105th anniversary or 105th birthday of Ronald Reagan. His 11 Commandment was not to speak ill of another Republican. So I'm not going to use this opportunity to savage the reputation of Senator Cruz. But I will say I will say I will say that I was very disappointed that members of his team thought so little of me that they thought that after having hundreds if not thousands of volunteers and college students who sacrificed their time and were dedicated to the cause one even died to think that I would just walk away ten minutes before the caucus and say ""Forget about you guys.""I mean who would do something like that? Now I don't think anyone on this stage would do something like that. And to assume that someone would what does that tell you? So unfortunately it did happen.It gives us a very good example of certain types of Washington ethics. Washington ethics. Washington ethics basically says if it's legal you do what you need to do in order to win. That's not my ethics. My ethics is you do what's right. Since I was mentioned... This is great you guys. I want you all to mention me when you say something. In fact the time line indicates that initial tweet from CNN was followed by another one within one minute that clarified that I was not dropping out. So what happened to that one it is unclear. But the bottom line is we can see what happened everybody can see what happened and you can make your own judgment. Good evening. Well thank you. You know I was hoping to get a chance to talk about North Korea. I was the only one who didn't get to do that and I've got stuff to say about it let me tell you. But at any rate you have to replace it with something that makes sense. It doesn't make sense. And the reason that I dislike Obamacare is because the government comes in and tells the people which the nation is supposed to be centered on that we don't care what you think this is what we're doing. And if you don't like it too bad. That's a problem. And we can't afford to do that because that will fundamentally change America.I have proposed a health empowerment account system. Everybody gets a health empowerment account the day they are born they keep it until they die. They can pass it on. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional health care with recognizing that we spend twice as much as many countries per capita and health care and don't have as such access.We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account so that each family basically becomes its own insurance company without a middleman; that saves you a awful lot of money. And that will lower the cost of your catastrophic insurance tremendously because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic health care.And then in terms of taking care of the indigent we have another whole system and I can go ahead and explain it but I don't have the time but I'd be happy to if you give me some more time.

2016-02-06 00:00:00,bush, Chris why don't you mention my name so I can get into this. ... I appreciate that I really do thank you. Well first of all he said the exact same thing about me that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering. I said the same thing about Marco. I think we were both right at the time and Mitt picked somebody else. So let's move on to the 2016 race. Who has the leadership skills... ...who has the leadership skills to lead? And I'm proud of the fact that I have 12 Medal of Honor recipients over 30 admirals and generals that believe that I would be a steady hand as Commander in Chief. That I serve as Governor of the state of Florida where we cut taxes and reduced government. I took on very powerful interests forged consensus fought for my beliefs implemented them and the state was better off. We had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. The whole state was turned upside down. It required a steady hand. Leadership. You learn this you learn it by doing it. It's not something that you just go up and on the job do it. It's not the same. Look let's be clear. Marco Rubio is a gifted gifted politician and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States but we've tried it the old way with Barack Obama with soaring eloquence and we got we didn't get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up. The next President... ...going to have to forge consensus to bring about a set of common purposes so that we can move forward again in this country... ... this relates to strategic patience. This relates to the strategic patience of the Obama administration. They come up with these great marketing terms and what they do is they pull back and voids are filled and they're now filled by asymmetric threats of terror as well as nation-states on the run. The next president of the United States is gonna have to get the United States back in the game and if a preemptive strike is necessary to keep us safe then we should do it. Well first of all it's interesting that that happened literally days when this hostage release took place in Iran. A day or two days afterwards North Korea took a held an American student hostage. I think it's when we send a signal of weakness when we are negotiating to release people that committed crimes in our country for people that didn't commit crimes that are held hostage in Iran. We saw the shameful treatment of our sailors that this creates weakness sends a signal of weakness around the world. The next president of the United States is going to have to get back in the game. Where the United States' word matters. Where we back up our allies where we don't send signals of weakness. We need to use every every influence possible to get this student back.And I think John is right about this there are crippling sanctions that are available as it relates to the two or three banks that North Korea uses to to use it illicit trade. We ought to re-establish sanctions not just because of the student but because of their actions that they're taking right now as it relates to building this missile capability. Good evening. The difference the difference between eminent domain for public purpose as Donald said roads and infrastructure pipelines and all that that's for public purpose. But what Donald Trump did was use eminent domain to try to take the property of an elderly woman on the strip in Atlantic City. That is not public purpose that is down right wrong. And here's the problem with that. The problem was it was to tear down it was to tear down it was to tear down the house... And the net result was you tried. And you lost in the court. That is not true. And the simple fact is to turn this into a limousine parking lot for his casinos is a not public use. And in Florida based on what we did we made that impossible. It is part of our Constitution. That's the better approach. That is the conservative approach. How tough it is to take away property from an elderly woman?

2016-02-06 00:00:00,mcelveen," Thank you David. And good evening candidates. Mr. Trump you have said quote ""I love eminent domain"" which is the seizure of private property for the sake of the greater good theoretically. You tried to use the measure in business endeavors you've said you'd support its use for the Keystone Pipeline project. Here in New Hampshire a project though known as the Northern pass would bring hydro-electric power from Canada into the Northeastern grid. Do you see eminent domain as an appropriate tool to get that done? So would that be yes on the Northern Pass project? Mr. Trump take 30 seconds. All right gentlemen... Gentlemen we do have to move forward. Dave Martha back to you. Thank you David. And good evening candidates.

2016-02-06 00:00:00,kasich," Well we've got to to step up the pressure. And by the way I've gotta say after being here every one of my 100 town hall meetings in New Hampshire were a lot more fun than what I saw here today were so much more positive. Look in terms of North Korea Martha we have to make sure that we intercept both the ships and their aircraft because what they're trying to do is to proliferate this very dangerous material along with the with the technology the instruments that can be used for mass destruction.That's what I worry about the most frankly is non-state actors people who don't have a uniform people don't have a country who can spread this who are not subject to the to the mutual assured defense. In other words you strike us we strike you.Some of these radicals they don't care about that. That's what I worry about for my children and for their children going forward. So we have to be very tough.And we should tell the Chinese look if you're not going to do this ballistic missile defense to the Koreans ballistic missile defense to Japan and by the way we should impose the same kind of sanctions on North Korea that we imposed on Iran because they're able to shift money. They're able to send money and receive money. We've gotta to be very tough on this. And frankly I think we could have I think we could have let the Japanese know that if you want to take action on that on that missile that's rising you want to take action you will have our support if that's what you think is the best thing to do. We cannot continue to be weak in the face of the North Koreans or frankly in the entire rest of the world.Martha this is this is the relates... Well you know David I I've just spent a lot of time here in this state as I mentioned earlier and we have to have practical solutions just like we were just talking about a few minutes ago on North Korea. Look the situation is we need to finish the border. It has to be completed. Just like we lock our doors at night the country has to be able to lock its doors. And we can have a guest worker program where people can come in and out in an orderly way. And then for the 11.5 million that are here if they have not committed a crime since they've been here I believe they ought to pay some back taxes pay a fine never get on the path to citizenship but get legalization. It is not I couldn't even imagine how we would even begin to think about taking a mom or a dad out of a house when they have not committed a crime since they've been here leaving their children in the house. I mean that is not in my opinion the kind of values that we believe in.And secondly I think at the end of the day that Americans would support a plan like this. I think Congress would pass a plan to finish the border guest worker pay a fine a path to legalization and not citizenship. And we've got to get this done. And I will tell you this within the first 100 days that I am president I will put that proposal to the Congress. And I will tell you as a former Congressman and an executive in Ohio I can promise you that I believe you'll get the votes to pass that and we can move on with that issue and protect our border. That's what I think. Good evening. Well first of all look. As the New York Times said he's certainly not a moderate but he can bring people together to solve problems. The fact of the matter is I've cut taxes more than anybody in the country this year. I have balanced budgets the federal budget the state of Ohio budget we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus we're up 400000 jobs and in Washington we were able to have significant job growth whenever we balanced the budget of which I was the architect. But here's the beauty of it it's not just balancing a budget it's about jobs. You know when I was kid growing up in a neighborhood where Dad went home at night and said ""I lost my job today"" it just killed the family.It just was a devastating effect. We have to have economic growth but once we have economic growth I believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows. I believe we need to help the mentally ill the drug addicted the working poor. We need to help the developmentally disabled to rise and we need to help our friends in the minority community develop entrepreneurship. In other words in American conservatism should mean not only that some rise with conservative principles but everybody has a chance to rise regardless of who they are so they can live their God given purpose. That's what conservatism should be. Well we've got to to step up the pressure. And by the way I've gotta say after being here every one of my 100 town hall meetings in New Hampshire were a lot more fun than what I saw here today were so much more positive.

2016-02-06 00:00:00,cruz," Well you know David the assessment the voters are making here in New Hampshire and across the country is they are evaluating each and every one of us. They are looking to our experience. They are looking to our knowledge. They are looking to our temperament and judgment. They are looking to our clarity of vision and our strength of resolve. The world is getting much more dangerous. We've had seven years with Barack Obama in the oval office a commander-in-chief that is unwilling even to acknowledge the enemy we're facing. This is a president who in the wake of Paris in the wake of San Bernardino will not even use the words radical Islamic terrorism much less focus on defeating the enemy.I am convinced every individual standing on this stage would make a much better commander-in-chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. And the primary voters are making the assessment for each of us who is best prepared to keep this country safe to rebuild the military to rebuild our Navy our Air Force our Army our Marines and to ensure that we keep America safe. I think that is an assessment the voters are going to make. And they are going to make it of each and everyone of us. They are going to assess who is level-headed who has clear vision who has judgment who can confront our enemies who can confront the threats we face in this country and who can have the judgment when to engage and when not to engage both are incredibly important for a commander-in-chief knowing how to go after our enemies. In the case of Iran for example who has the clarity of vision to understand that the Ayatollah Khamenei when he chants ""Death to America"" he means it. We need a president with the judgment and resolve to keep this country safe from radical Islamic terrorists. Ben is a good and honorable man and Ben and Candy have become friends. He has an amazing life story that has inspired millions including me. When this transpired I apologized to him then and I do so now. Ben I'm sorry. Let me tell you the facts of what occurred for those who are interested in knowing. On Monday night about 6:30 p.m. CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina. Rather he was quote ""Taking a break from campaigning.""They reported that on television CNN's political anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer said it was highly unusual and highly significant. My political team saw CNN's report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers it was being covered on live television.Now at the time I was at the caucuses I was getting ready to speak at the caucuses just like Ben was just like everyone else was. I knew nothing about this. A couple hours later I found out about it. I was told that Ben was unhappy. I called him that evening because I respect him very very highly. I didn't reach him that evening. I reached him the next day and apologized. He asked me then he said Ted would you make this apologize in public? I said yes I will. And I did so. I regret that subsequently CNN reported on that they didn't correct that story until 9:15 that night. So from 6:30 p.m. to 9:15 that's what CNN was reporting.Subsequent to that initial report Ben's campaign put out a statement saying that he was not suspending his campaign. I wish that our campaign staff had forwarded that statement. They were unaware of it I wish that they had that's why I apologized. Well I would note initially the fact that we're seeing the launch and we're seeing the launch from a nuclear North Korea is the direct result of the failures of the first Clinton administration. The Clinton administration led the world in relaxing sanctions against North Korea. Billions of dollars flowed into North Korea in exchange for promises not to build nuclear weapons. They took those billions and built nuclear weapons. And I would note also the lead negotiator in that failed North Korea sanctions deal was a woman named Wendy Sherman who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton promptly recruited to come back to be the lead negotiator with Iran. So what we are seeing with North Korea is foreshadowing of where we will be with Iran.With respect to North Korea and what we should do now one of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense capacity. We ought to put missile defense interceptors in South Korea. South Korea wants them. One of the real risks of this launch North Korea wants to launch a satellite and one of the greatest risks of the satellite is they would place a nuclear device in the satellite. As it would orbit around the Earth and as it got over the United States they would detonate that nuclear weapon and set of what's called an EMP and electromagnetic pulse which could take down the entire electrical grid on the Eastern seaboard potentially killing millions.We need to harden the grid to defend ourselves and we need missile defense to protect ourselves against North Korea. You know at this point I'm not going to speculate on that without the intelligence briefing that any Commander in Chief would have knowing what exactly is there. One of the real problems... ... Actually with respect I have gotten the intelligence briefings on the Mid-East. Those have been going on for many years. I haven't gotten the intelligence briefing tonight on what North Korea's doing because I'm here in new Hampshire. When you're responding to an immediate incident you need to know the intelligence of what's occurring. But what I was saying look it is qualitatively different dealing with a country once they have nuclear weapons. It's why you prevent them from getting nuclear weapons in the first place because your hands are somewhat tied once they have nukes.It's why this Iranian nuclear deal is so catastrophic and it's why I've pledged on the very first day in office to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal so we're not sitting here in five years wondering what to do about an Iranian missile launch when they have nuclear weapons. The stakes are too high for that. So in terms of a practical solution I've laid out the most detailed plan for solving illegal immigration. It's 11 pages single-spaced chapter and verse. It's on our website tedcruz.org. In short we're going to do we're going to build a wall. We're going to triple the border patrol. We're going to increase and actually since Donald enjoyed that I will simply say I've got somebody in mind to build it.We're going to increase four-fold the fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft so that you have technology monitoring an attempted incursion to direct the boots on the ground where they're occurring. We're going to put in place a strong e-verify system in the workplace so you can't get a job without proving you are here legally.We'll put in place a biometric exit-entry system on visas because 40 percent of illegal immigration comes not over the border illegally but people coming on visas and overstaying.We will end sanctuary cities by cutting off taxpayer dollars to any jurisdiction that defies federal immigration law. And we will end welfare benefits for those here illegally. What you do is you enforce the law. You know under the Constitution the president has an obligation to quote ""Take care that the laws be faithfully executed."" Federal immigration law provides if someone is here illegally and is apprehended they are to be deported. We saw just this past week the head of the border patrol union testify before Congress that President Obama had given the order to the border patrol to stand down not to enforce the law. That is wrong. I will enforce the law and for everyone who says you can't possibly do that I would note that in eight years Bill Clinton deported 12 million people.In eight years George W. Bush deported 10 million people. Enforcing the law we can do it. What is missing is the political will. And when they were deporting the people the border wasn't secure so they'd come right back. Once you secure the border enforcing the law will solve this problem and that will benefit American workers. Good evening. Well let me take two different parts of that. Let me start with socialized medicine. Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine that have put the government in charge of providing medicine what inevitably happens is rationing. You have a scarcity of doctors. You have rationing. And that means the elderly are told we're going to ration a hip replacement we're going to ration a knee replacement. We're going to ration end- of-life care.We're right now heading into a medical system with about a 90000-doctor shortage in America and socialized medicine; whether proposed by the Democrats or proposed by a Republican would hurt the people of this country.What should we do on health care? If I'm elected president we will repeal every word of Obamacare. And once we do that we will adopt common sense reforms number one we'll allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines that will drive down prices and expand the availability of low cost catastrophic insurance.We'll expand health savings accounts; and we will de-link health insurance from employment so that you don't lose your health insurance when you lose your job and that way health insurance can be personal portable and affordable and we keep government from getting in between us and our doctors. Well you know David the assessment the voters are making here in New Hampshire and across the country is they are evaluating each and every one of us. They are looking to our experience. They are looking to our knowledge. They are looking to our temperament and judgment. They are looking to our clarity of vision and our strength of resolve. The world is getting much more dangerous. We've had seven years with Barack Obama in the oval office a commander-in-chief that is unwilling even to acknowledge the enemy we're facing. This is a president who in the wake of Paris in the wake of San Bernardino will not even use the words radical Islamic terrorism much less focus on defeating the enemy.I am convinced every individual standing on this stage would make a much better commander-in-chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. And the primary voters are making the assessment for each of us who is best prepared to keep this country safe to rebuild the military to rebuild our Navy our Air Force our Army our Marines and to ensure that we keep America safe. I think that is an assessment the voters are going to make. And they are going to make it of each and everyone of us. They are going to assess who is level-headed who has clear vision who has judgment who can confront our enemies who can confront the threats we face in this country and who can have the judgment when to engage and when not to engage both are incredibly important for a commander-in-chief knowing how to go after our enemies. In the case of Iran for example who has the clarity of vision to understand that the Ayatollah Khamenei when he chants ""Death to America"" he means it. We need a president with the judgment and resolve to keep this country safe from radical Islamic terrorists. Ben is a good and honorable man and Ben and Candy have become friends.

2016-02-06 00:00:00,ham," Thanks David. Good evening guys. Mr. Trump. In the Democratic primary Hillary Clinton has criticized Bernie Sanders' plan for single payer government health care noting it would require big across the board tax increases for Americans. In doing so she's doubling down on Obamacare despite its persistent unpopularity. Mr. Trump you have said you want to appeal Obamacare. You have also said quote ""Everybody's got to be covered"" adding quote ""The government's going to pay for it."" Are you closer to Bernie Sanders' vision for health care than Hillary Clinton's? Dr. Carson you have some experience with this matter. In the past you have said that Obamacare should be replaced before it's repealed. How and why? Thank you Dr. Carson. David Martha back to you.

2016-03-10 00:00:00,trump," One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting. They're voting out of enthusiasm. They're voting out of love. Some of these people frankly have never voted before 50 years old 60 years old 70 years old never voted before. We're taking people from the Democrat Party. We're taking people as independents and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It's very exciting. I think frankly the Republican establishment or whatever you want to call it should embrace what's happening.We're having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we're going to beat them soundly. Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I'm a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly because of the devaluations that other countries the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us it's very very hard for our companies in this country in our country to compete. So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do believe me. I will. First of all I think and I know the H1B very well. And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very very bad for workers. And second of all I think it's very important to say well I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do. When it's sitting there waiting for you but it's very bad. It's very bad for business in terms of and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly the Disney workers endorsed me as you probably read.And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said and they had a news conference and they said he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see just to answer the second part of your question where we are where we stand what's going on.We have to sort of take a strong good hard look and come up with plans that work. And we're rushing into things and we're just we're leading with the chin. We're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I'd say a minimum of one year maybe two years. Education through Washington D.C. I don't want that. I want local education. I want the parents and I want all of the teachers and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great. And it was very interesting I was with Dr. Ben Carson today who is endorsing me by the way tomorrow morning and he is... We were talking. We spoke for over an hour on education. And he has such a great handle on it. He wants competitive schools. He wants a lot of different things that are terrific including charter schools by the way that the unions are fighting like crazy. But charter schools work and they work very well.So there are a lot of things. But I'm going to have Ben very involved with education something that's an expertise of his. You're right Jake. But it has been taken over by the federal government. It was originally supposed to be that way. And certainly sounds better that way. But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington and they are not interested in what's happening in Miami or in Florida in many cases. Now in some cases they would be. But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children. Well first of all I want you to understand that the Democrats and I've watched them very intensely even though it's a very very boring thing to watch that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They're leaving it the way it is. In fact they want to increase it. They want to actually give more. And that's what we're up against. And whether we like it or not that is what we're up against.I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste fraud and abuse which is rampant in this country rampant totally rampant.And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.You have 22 years you have a long time to go. It's not long in terms of what we're talking about but it's still a long time to go and I want to leave Social Security as is I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs I want to do things that will make us that will bring back GDP...I mean as an example GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent 8 percent and it's a it's a national tragedy. We're at zero we're not doing anything.We've lost our jobs. We've lost everything. We're losing everything. Our jobs are gone our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We're going to get rid of waste fraud abuse and bring back business. Because they don't cover most of the subjects. We're the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We're going to have a stronger military much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany we take care of Saudi Arabia we take care of Japan we take care of South Korea. We take every time this maniac from North Korea does anything we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing. We have 28000 soldiers on the line on the border between North and South Korea. We have so many places. Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. We are going to be in a different world. We're going to negotiate real deals now and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country. We owe $19 trillion. We're going to bring wealth back to our country. Well I don't know if he's saying that. Look I'm just saying very simply we have a country that I've never seen anything like it. I've been going over budgets and looking at budgets. We don't bid things out. We don't bid out as an example the drug industry pharmaceutical industry. They don't go out to bid. They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store. That's what they're paying. And the reason is they have a fantastic lobby. They take care of all of the senators the Congressmen. They have great power and they don't bid out. The military is never properly bid. When we go out to military bids it's not properly bid. And the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don't want only because that particular company has political juice OK?I'm self-funding my campaign. Nobody is going to be taking care of me. I don't want anybody's money. I will tell you something. We're going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government. We're going to save a fortune. Yes. If you look back to Iowa Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit. He did and at the end. Not full on but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well. And you know I think everybody knows that. It was a front page story all over the place and he did make a change. Well that's fine. First of all Ted was in favor of amnesty. So there's no question about that. And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there's nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe. And Jeff Sessions one of the most respected Senator in Washington an incredible man also endorsed me. And there's nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions. I would say this. We're all in this together. We're going to come up with solutions. We're going to find the answers to things. And so far I cannot believe how civil it's been up here. Well first of all I don't really think that. I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people. We are more inclusive. And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls it's again the biggest story. You look at all of these people that are coming in something is happening. I am different in one primary respect and that's trade. I feel that we have had horrible negotiators horrible trade deals. The jobs in this country are disappearing and especially the good jobs.You look at the recent jobs reports which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good because all of these people looking for jobs when they give up they go home they give up and they are considered statistically employed. So that's that.But I will say trade deals are absolutely killing our country. The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many many other countries and we don't do it because we don't play the game. and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave.If you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs.And if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years their salary and their pay have gone down not up. It has gone down. And I think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I'm saying. The 45 percent tax is a threat. It was not a tax it was a threat. It will be a tax if they don't behave. Take China as an example. I have many friends great manufacturers they want to go into China. They can't. China won't let them. We talk about free trade. It's not tree free trade it's stupid trade. China dumps everything that they have over here. No tax no nothing no problems no curfews no anything. We can't get into China. I have the best people manufacturers they can't get in. When they get in they have to pay a tremendous tax.The 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides we will tax you. It doesn't have to be 45 it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell. Jake I have to say honestly it's just the opposite. What will happen if they don't behave we will put on a tax of some amount and it could be a large amount and we will start building those factories and those plants. Instead of in China we'll build them here. And people will buy products from here rather than buying it through China where we're being ripped off. And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now. So we'll build our factories here and we'll make our own products. And that's the way it should be done. And the way we've been doing it for the last long period of time is our country our country is in serious serious trouble. It's a bubble and it's going to explode believe me. I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them. Well you know I've been watching the debate today. And they're talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam. But I will tell you this. There's something going on that maybe you don't know about maybe a lot of other people don't know about but there's tremendous hatred. And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper. Marco talks about consequences. Well we've had a lot of consequences including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center the Pentagon and could have been the White House. There have been a lot of problems. Now you can say what you want and you can be politically correct if you want. I don't want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems. We have a serious serious problem of hate. There is tremendous hate. There is tremendous hate. Where large portions of a group of people Islam large portions want to use very very harsh means. Let me go a step further. Women are treated horribly. You know that. You do know that. Women are treated horribly and other things are happening that are very very bad. Now I will say this there is tremendous hatred. The question was asked what do you think? I said there is hatred. Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently. And everybody would say oh isn't that wonderful. We better solve the problem before it's too late. Let me go back to the other just for a second. In large mosques all over the Middle East you have people chanting ""death to the USA."" Now that does not sound like a friendly act to me. As far as the families are concerned and as far as the law is concerned we have a law this all started with your question on water boarding. We have a law that doesn't allow right now water boarding. They have no laws. They have no rules. They have no regulations. They chop off heads. They drown 40 50 60 people at a time in big steel cages pull them up an hour later everyone dead. And we're working on a different set of parameters.Now we have to obey the laws. Have to obey the laws. But we have to expand those laws because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad.We better expand our laws or we're being a bunch of suckers and they are laughing at us. They are laughing at us believe me. First of all there's nobody on this stage that's more pro Israel than I am. OK. There's nobody. I am pro-Israel. I was the grand marshall not so long ago of the Israeli Day Parade down 5th avenue. I've made massive contributions to Israel. I have a lot of I have tremendous love for Israel. I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish OK? And two grandchildren that are Jewish. But I will tell you I think if we're going to ever negotiate a peace settlement which every Israeli wants and I've spoken to the toughest and the sharpest they all want peace I think it would be much more helpful is I'm a negotiator. If I go in I'll say I'm pro-Israel and I've told that to everybody and anybody that would listen.But I would like to at least have the other side think I'm somewhat neutral as to them so that we can maybe get a deal done. Maybe we can get a deal. I think it's probably the toughest negotiation of all time. But maybe we can get a deal done. And by the way just so you understand as far as Iran I would have never made that deal. I think it's maybe the world deal I've ever seen. I think it's the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated. I will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they've ever behaved in their lives which is probably unlikely. That deal will be broken. If I become president of the United States one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one protection of Israel but also seeing if a deal can be made the toughest deal the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look no matter how hard you look. But I would like to give it a shot. Very very pro-Israel nobody more pro-Israel. But I would love to give it a shot. And I have to tell you this Hugh. I have friend Israelis non-Israelis people from New York City that happen to be Jewish and love Israel and some are very tough people every single one of them they know it's tough but every single one of them wants to see if we could ever have peace in Israel.And some believe it's possible. It may not be in which case we'll find out. But it would be a priority if I become president to see what I could do. We really have no choice. We have to knock out ISIS. We have to knock the hell out of them. We have to get rid of it. And then come back and rebuild our country which is falling apart. We have no choice. I would listen to the generals but I'm hearing numbers of 20000 to 30000. We have to knock them out fast. Look we're not allowed to fight. We can't fight. We're not knocking out the oil because they don't want to create environmental pollution up in the air. I mean these are things that nobody even believes. They think we're kidding. They didn't want to knock out the oil because of what it's going to do to the carbon footprint. We don't fight like we used to fight. We used to fight to win. Now we fight for no reason whatsoever. We don't even know what we're doing. So the answer is we have to knock them out. We have to knock them out fast. And we have to get back home. And we have to rebuild our country which is falling apart. Well I don't really agree with President Obama. I think I'm somewhere in the middle. What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now Cuba is making as usual with our country we don't make good deal. We don't have our right people negotiating we have people that don't have a clue. As an example I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States and nobody's talking about it and they'll end up signing a deal and then we'll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion.All that stuff has to be agreed to now. We don't want to get sued after the deal is made. So I don't agree with President Obama I do agree something should be should take place. After 50 years it's enough time folks. But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that's going to happen.This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh here we go we make a deal then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations. So I want to do something but it's got to be done intelligently. We have to make good deal. I would want to make a good deal I would want to make a strong solid good deal because right now everything is in Cuba's favor. Right now everything every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba's favor. It the same way as the Iran deal. We never walked we never all we do is keep giving. We give and give and give. I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States. Well if Ted was listening he would have heard me say something very similar. I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us. And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear. And I think after 50 years and I have many friends I own many properties in Miami many many and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do make a deal it would be great but it's got to be a great deal for the United States not a bad deal for the United States. As far as Iran is concerned I would have never made that deal. That is one of the worst deals ever ever made by this country. It is a disaster. So for Ted to say I agree with this deal I mean it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I've ever seen negotiated. So don't try to put it on me like it's wonderful like I love it. I was against the giving of the money at all cost. I said don't negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back. If the prisoners don't come back early three years ago. One of the longest negotiations I've ever seen by the way. If they don't come back early I was saying don't negotiate. They come back early. What you do is you take it back and you say either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions. What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal. Cause that deal is a disaster.Ted the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very very poor negotiators. But that money the $150 billion is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States. That doesn't mean I was endorsing that. I was not endorsing it. I said that is a strong powerful government that put it down with strength. And then they kept down the riot. It was a horrible thing. It doesn't mean at all I was endorsing it. As far as Putin is concerned I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia. I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader that I can tell you. I mean for Russia that doesn't mean I'm endorsing Putin. I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany. Germany is a disaster right now. So I used to think that. And strong doesn't mean good. Putin is a strong leader absolutely. I could name many strong leaders. I could name very many very weak leaders. But he is a strong leader. Now I don't say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact. I hope not. I truly hope not. I will say this. We have 25 30000 people you've seen it yourself. People come with tremendous passion and love for the country and when they see protest in some cases you know you're mentioning one case which I haven't seen I heard about it which I don't like. But when they see what's going on in this country they have anger that's unbelievable. They have anger. They love this country. They don't like seeing bad trade deals they don't like seeing higher taxes they don't like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated. And I know I mean I see it. There is some anger. There's also great love for the country. It's a beautiful thing in many respects. But I certainly do not condone that at all Jake. We have some protesters who are bad dudes they have done bad things. They are swinging they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people. And we had a couple big strong powerful guys doing damage to people not only the loudness the loudness I don't mind. But doing serious damage. And if they've got to be taken out to be honest I mean we have to run something. And it's not me. It's usually the municipal government the police because I don't have guards all over these stadiums. I mean we fill up stadiums. It's usually the police and by the way speaking of the police we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job. So we should pay we should truly give our police. They're incredible people we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive. It shows the total dishonesty of the press. We were having on a few occasions again massive crowds. And we're talking and I'm saying who is going to vote on Tuesday? Who is going to vote? The place goes crazy. Then I say hey do me a favor. Raise your right hand. Do you swear you're going to vote for Donald Trump? Everyone's laughing we're all having a good time. That's why I have much bigger crowds than Ted because we have a good time at mine. But we're all having a good time and the next day on the Today Show and a couple of other place not too many. Because when you look at it everyone's smiling laughing. Their arms are raised like this. They had pictures still pictures of people and they tried to equate it to Nazi Germany. It is a disgrace. It was a total disgrace. And I've had reporters people that you know come up to me and said that what they did on the Today Show was a disgrace. I think that what should happen getting back maybe a little bit to your first question I think that whoever first of all I think I'm going to have the delegates. OK? I think. Let's see what happens. But if somebody doesn't have the delegates and I guess there's two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment. But if no that's just by the way that is not meant to be a criticism. That's just a mathematical fact. OK?If two of us get up there I would say this if if Marco if the governor if Ted had more votes than me in the form of delegates I think whoever gets to the top position as opposed to solving that artificial number that was by somebody which is a very random number I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win. That's what I think. Make me president. You know I listen and I watch Ted on television and when he speaks and he's always saying ""I'm the only one that beat Donald in six contests; and I beat him."" But I beat him in 13 contests. He never mentions that. And let me just tell you another little fact little minor fact. I have about a 1.6 million votes during this primary season more votes than Ted. The other thing is I beat Hillary and I will give you the list I beat Hillary in many of the polls that have been taken. And each week I get better and better. And believe me I haven't even started on her yet. I have not made that decision yet. I will make a decision on that but I have not made that decision. My decision was that I would go through the entire primary season and I have turned down probably $275 million worth. I have many many friends that come up all day long $5 million $10 million I'm turning down money. I feel sort of foolish to be honest with you. I don't know if I get any credit for it but I'm self-funding my campaign. And other than and by the way other than very small donations where people are sending in $200 $15 $20 and we have some of that but it's not a large amount. No I'm self-funding my campaign and the reason is that I've been in this business a long time and I was on the other side until eight months ago I was on the or side. I made massive contributions large contributions to politicians both Democrats and Republicans. I was liked by everybody which is an important thing.I will say this people control special interests lobbyists donors they make large contributions to politicians and they have total control over those politicians. I don't want anybody to control me but the people right out there. And I'm going to do the right thing. Ted was given to PACs. I mean PACs you know these super PACs are a disaster by the way folks. Very corrupt. It's going to lead to lots of disasters. But Ted has super PACs and you have to look at the people that are giving to those super PACs number one. It's very important to do that. There is total control of the candidates I know it better than anybody that probably ever lived. And I will tell you this I know the system far better than anybody else and I know the system is broken. And I'm the one because I know it so well because I was on both sides of it I was on the other side all my life and I've always made large contributions.And frankly I know the system better than anybody else and I'm the only one up here that's going to be able to fix that system because that system is wrong. It depends on what comes up. You never know. It depends on what comes up. Look look we had a great president Ronald Reagan. We had Tip O'Neill speaker. And what do we do we take these two men that are very very different men they got along they had relationships and they got things and very beautifully. Nobody is complaining about the deals that Ronald Reagan made. And he made it with Tip O'Neill. We need to have people get together and work good deals out good deals out from our standpoint. And I'll tell you this it can be done.We don't want to continue to watch people signing executive orders because that was not what the Constitution and the brilliant designers of this incredible document had in mind. We need people that can make deals and can work because right now in Washington there's total absolute gridlock. Thank you very much. The Republican Party has a great chance to embrace millions of people that it's never known before. They're coming by the millions. We should seize that opportunity. These are great people. These are fantastic people. These are people that love our country. These are people that want to see America be great again.These are people that will win us the election and win it easily. These are people that once the election is won will be able to put Supreme Court justices up that will do a fabulous job. Because let me tell you if we lose this election you're going to have three four or maybe even five justices and this country will never ever recover. It will take centuries to recover.So I just say embrace these millions of people that now for the first time ever love the Republican Party. And unify. Be smart and unify."
2016-03-10 00:00:00,tapper," Live from the Bank United Center on the campus of the University of Miami this is the CNN Republican Presidential debate. For our viewers in the United States and around the world welcome to Miami Florida I'm Jake Tapper. In just five days voters will go to the polls here in this state as well as in Ohio Illinois North Carolina and Missouri. The race for the Republican nomination for president could change dramatically.Florida and Ohio each have a large number of delegates at stake and they award all of them to the candidate who wins. They're a winner-take-all state. So that's the first time that will happen in this primary season and this is the last debate before that critical round of voting.We hope tonight the candidates will give the voters specifics on their visions for America.So now let's welcome the candidates.Ohio Governor John Kasich. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Real estate developer and businessman Donald Trump. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Ladies and gentlemen the Republican candidates for president of the United States. Before we begin this evening we want to remember former first lady Nancy Reagan who passed away this week. Her funeral will be held tomorrow and we would like to take a moment of silence to remember Nancy Reagan. Now please rise for our national anthem performed by the Frost Singers from the University of Miami. Thanks to the Frost Singers from the University of Miami.Candidates you can now take your positions behind the podiums while I briefly explain the rules. As moderator I will attempt to guide the discussion asking questions and followups. Joining me in the questioning this evening will be Washington Times reporter Stephen Dinan CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash and Salem Radio's Hugh Hewitt.Candidates you have one minute and 15 seconds to answer each question and 45 seconds to respond to followups or for rebuttals if your name is invoked. That's longer than you've had in previous debates.Timing lights will be visible. Those lights will warn you when time is up. And as you requested a bell will also sound like this. We know that each of you wants to debate these important issues but please wait until you are called upon and please do not talk over one another. These are the rules to which all of you agreed.Our goal this evening is a serious debate on the issues.It's time now for opening statements. You'll each have 30 seconds.Governor Kasich we will start with you. Senator Rubio? Senator Cruz? Mr. Trump? Thank you. Thank you. Let's begin with jobs and the economy which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election. There have been some real differences expressed in on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers. One of Mr. Trump's the front runner's signature issues is ending what he calls ""disastrous trade deals"" in order to bring jobs back to America.Governor Kasich I'd like to start with you. You've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years. Critics say these deals are great for corporate America's bottom line but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs. How do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class? Mr. Trump your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico. Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses? Senator Rubio last October you said that you're quote ""generally very much in favor of free trade."" More recently you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. If elected will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs? Senator Cruz you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal but after taking some heat from conservatives you changed your position. Why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years? Let's talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers. Let's go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen. Senator Rubio did you want to weigh in? Education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy. The United States has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world. American students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading. Mr. Trump you've called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster. What are your specific objections to Common Core? OK. But just to clarify the Common Core standards were developed by the states states and localities voluntarily adopt them and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards. So when you say ""education by Washington D.C."" what do you mean? Governor Kasich you have called opposition to Common Core hysteria. What is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you? So Senator Cruz let me bring you in. You object to Common Core. Governor Kasich says it's local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards. What's wrong with that? Let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida. Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country. There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations. Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash. Thank you Governor. Let's take a broader look at the Republican Party now. Mr. Trump one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition.How are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader? What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016? Thank you Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz... ...Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote. Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party. What do you think is wrong with that vision? Mr. Trump we'll give you a chance to respond. Senator Cruz? OK. All right. We're going to take a very quick break. When we come back we'll have much more of this Republican presidential debate from the University of Miami right after this. Stay with us. Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami Florida. Mr. Trump let me start with you. Last night you told CNN quote ""Islam hates us?"" Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims. Thank you Senator. Governor Kasich do you think Islam hates us? Thank you Governor Kasich. Mr. Trump I want to ask you about something else you've said during the course of this campaign. You said that the U.S. has to quote ""take out"" the families of terrorists. When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions you said quote ""So they can kill us but we can't kill them?""It is against federal military and international law to target civilians. So how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists while also abiding by the law? Senator Rubio would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists? Senator Cruz you've talked about changing the rules of engagement in battle against ISIS. Would that include targeting the families of suspected terrorists? Thank you Mr. Trump. Let's turn from current conflicts to those who have served in conflicts.Senator Rubio according to a V.A. study of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day 17 of them have no connection to the V.A. The V.A. believes that this lack of connection is one of the reasons for this tragically high suicide rate.What specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need? Governor Kasich the Veterans Affairs Department is one of the biggest line items in the domestic budget. As part of its attempt to cut costs the Republican-controlled House of Representatives just voted to try to reduce spending in the post-9/11 GI Bill. Should veterans' benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit? Thank you Governor Kasich. Let's turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida. Just over a week from now President Obama will visit Cuba the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba.Two of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States. Let's go back to my colleague Dana Bash. Thank you governor. Thank you governor. While we're discussing the issues of importance to Floridians I reached out to the Republican mayor of Miami Tomas Regalado to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening. Mayor Regalado told me quote ""Climate change means rising ocean levels which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. It's an every day reality in our city. Will you as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president will you pledge to do something about it?"" Unquote.Senator Rubio the Miami mayor has endorsed you. Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it? So just to clarify Senator Rubio Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change the Republican mayor of Miami he's saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change. When you talk to him because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you do you tell him that he's wrong? Governor Kasich what would you say to the mayor of Miami? Thank you Governor. Senator Cruz I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world. Senator Cruz Colin Powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the U.S. abroad. He said quote ""foreigners of the world looking at this are distressed."" Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States? Thank you Senator. Mr. Trump some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators. You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China's massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square you've said: ""When the students poured into Tiananmen Square the Chinese government almost blew it then they were vicious they were horrible but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength.""How do you respond... But the word strong obviously is a compliment... ...and many people would look at what the Chinese leaders have done and what Putin is doing as atrocities. Governor Kasich when you were a member of Congress you were outspoken about the Tiananmen Square massacre. What do you think? Thank you Governor Kasich. We're going to take another quick break. When we come back we'll have more of the Republican presidential debate from Miami Florida right after this. Stay with us. Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami Florida. Mr. Trump I want to start with you in this block. Earlier today a man was arrested and charged with assault after sucker- punching a protester in the face at your rally in Fayettville North Carolina. This is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies.Today Hillary Clinton your potential general election opponent clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign. She said quote ""this kind of behavior is repugnant. We set the tone for our campaigns we should encourage respect not violence."" Do you believe that you've done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged? Some of your critics point to quotes you've made at these debates at these rallies including February 23rd ""I'd like to punch him in the face"" referring to a protesters. February 27th ""in the good ol' days they'd have ripped him out of that seat so fast."" February 1st ""knock the crap out of him would you? Seriously OK just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees I promise I promise."" Senator Cruz are you concerned at all that these kind of scenes potentially hurt the Republican party for the general election? Thank you senator. Mr. Trump if you'd like to respond. Governor Kasich do you worry about the scenes of violence at some of these rallies affecting the Republican party's chances in November? Thank you governor. Senator Rubio? I know you want to say something. Thank you senator. Thank you senator. The math suggests that it possible that not one of you will reach the magic number of 1237 delegates before the Republican convention which would mean a contested convention. Let's go back to Salem Radio's Hugh Hewitt. Thank you Senator. Let's send it back to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen? Thank you Governor. We have time for one last break. We'll be right back after this. And we're back with the Republican presidential debate just five days before the next primary elections. It is time now for closing statements. Candidates you will each have one minute. And we'll start with Governor Kasich. Senator Rubio. Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump?"
2016-03-10 00:00:00,dinan," Senator Rubio in late 2014 Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando replacing many of them with foreign workers. Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements. You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans? Senator Rubio real quick follow-up on this. You've in the in the context of illegal immigration you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured. Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved. Governor Kasich I want to come to you next. Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote ""lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers"". He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.? Mr. Trump I do want to come to you. Will you also in your answer address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like. Senator Cruz I want to bring you in very quickly on this. The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers. What should the right level be? Do you want to clarify the comment at all? Senator Rubio your supporter Republican Senator Jeff Sessions said in response to Mr. Trump's comment last night I'm sorry Senator Jeff Flake I apologize. Your supporter Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment Republicans are better than this. Do you agree? Mr. Trump? Mr. Trump thank you. Senator Rubio? Mr. Trump one of your biggest selling points is that you are largely self-funding your campaign and you argue your opponents are controlled by their special interest donors. Will you maintain your pledge not to take outside contributions throughout the general election? Senator Cruz I want to come to you. The vast majority of Republicans and voters overall agree with Mr. Trump that candidates are beholden to people and groups who donate to their campaigns. Do you deny that those big donors do have influence? Thank you Senator. I want to go to Mr. Trump... ... for a response. Thank you Senator. Thank you Mr. Trump. Senator Rubio I want to come to you with a question. At the last debate you mocked Mr. Trump for being flexible. With so much gridlock in Washington how can you expect to lead the country and get things done if you aren't willing to show flexibility? All right. Mr. Trump I want to give you a chance to respond but specifically you talked about flexibility and one of the examples you gave was the height of the border fence. What are some of the other issues on which you're willing to show flexibility? Thank you. I want to go to Governor Kasich on this issue of flexibility sir."
2016-03-10 00:00:00,rubio," Every election is important. I believe this is the most important election in a generation. Because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. What's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people. For over two centuries America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century. No I support free trade deals that are good for America. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If all we do is sell things to each other we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things. The problem is we're a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.There are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example here in Florida we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia.On the other hand you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America if given access to foreign markets our workers are the most productive in the world our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal we can compete against anyone in the world and we need to in the 21st century. If it's being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans but that you've tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process they should never be allowed to use it again. The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata for example out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire Disney or some other company hires this company.What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else they're employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.It is illegal now it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that whether it be Disney or anyone else they should be barred from using the program in the future. Correct. Well first I think well I'd be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American. If there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job that's in violation of the law. And what I'm explaining to you is what they are doing now is they are not what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn't replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way. Well I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in those aren't actually workers at all. They are just coming in primarily based on family connection. And ;let me tell you when my parents came in 1956 I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system. The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. When my parents came they had a very limited education. My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. And I'm grateful every day that America welcomed them.But today in the 21st Century 60 years later finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult. We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration not just on H-1B particularly on green cards. The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be what skills do you have? What business are you going to open? What investment are you going to make? What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States? Well first of all let me say that you're right there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare. One of them is my mother who happens to be here today. I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother. And we don't have to make any changes for them. But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying ""We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is"" they're not being honest with you. Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger like myself people that are 30 years away from retirement to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.For example instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire I'd have to retire at 68. If I were still in the Senate I'd be one of the youngest people there. If I've made a lot of money my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. And by the way Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better. Medicare Advantage does that now.These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire when my grandchildren retire when I retire. Well I'm sorry I didn't answer that part. So the thing is that my my generation someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time. But again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We're years away from retirement. For people that are on it now we don't have to change it at all. If we don't do anything we will have a debt crisis. It's not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare Medicaid the interest on the debt.That's all of it will be eaten up by that. That's a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis. No. And I and I think you've outlined why. The numbers don't add up. You know when I ran for the Senate in 2010 I came out and said we're going to have to make changes to Social Security and everyone said that's the end of your campaign. In Florida you can't talk about that but people know that it's the truth here in Florida. Fraud is not enough. Certainly let's wipe out the fraud but as you said it won't add up. You already gave those numbers. The second point is on foreign aid. I hear that all the time as well. I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget. The numbers don't add up.The bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse. Let's get rid of fraud let's get rid of abuse let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.And here's the thing. If we do not do it we will have a debt crisis. Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare. Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it. It is one of the major issues confronting America. It's barely been asked in any of these debates. And we'd better deal with or we're going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster. Well let me say I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say. The problem is presidents can't just say anything they want. It has consequences here and around the world. And so let me give you one. Two days ago I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh. It's a very tough place to be a missionary. It's Muslim.And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them that may not convert but protect them and certainly look out for them. And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well. And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America leading political figures are saying that America doesn't like Muslims. So this is a real impact. There's no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world.I can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery especially Arlington you're going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world you're going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims. And they love America. And as far as I know no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military. Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America. No matter what their religious background may be. Well here we go. See I'm not interested in being politically correct. I'm not interested in being politically correct. I'm interested in being correct. And in order to be correct on this issue here's the bottom line. We do work. There is Islam has a major problem on its hands. It has a significant percentage of its adherents particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia who have been radicalized. And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people.There is no doubt about that. It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face we are going to have to work together with other with Muslims who do not who are not radicals. We're going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom.We're going to have to work with the Saudis. We're going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms. We're going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat for example ISIS. It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them.And so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct. We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization. No of course not. And we don't have to in order to defeat terrorists. The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward. It's difficult to do but it has to be done. When I'm president of the United States the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung. They're going to be expanded. And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists. And then the best military in the world which needs to be rebuilt because because Barack Obama is gutting our military. He's going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II and the smallest Navy in a century and the smallest Air Force we've ever had.We are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them. And if we capture any of these terrorists alive they're not going to have the right to remain silent. And they're not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan. They're going to go to Guantanamo Bay Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we'll do so legally. Well that's undeniable. First of all they've said they've encouraged people to do so. And you've seen the speeches of the Palestinian Authority president how glorious this is that they're doing these sorts of things. But let me go back for a moment. The policy Donald has outlined I don't know if he realizes is an anti-Israeli policy. Maybe that's not your intent but here's why it is an anti-Israeli policy. There is no peace deal possible with the Palestinians at this moment. There just isn't. Because there's no one to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with Hamas an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state. Every time that Israel has turned over territory of any kind be is Gaza or now in Judea and Sumaira it is used as a launching pad to attack Israel. And that's what will happen again.These groups are not interested in a deal with Israel. What they are interested in is ultimately removing the Jewish state and occupying its entire territory. So maybe in 30 years the conditions will exist but they do not exist now. And To have a president forcing the Israelis to the table is harmful to the Israeli and emboldens Israel's enemies. Well first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that's struggling with the V.A. my brother is a veteran. He's struggling with the V.A. The other day we heard this horrible story. It was a headline in USA Today and it said ""Calls to the V.A. Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail."" Well about a few days ago we now found out that one of the gentlemen one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide. And they happened to call him back the day after he died.People need to be held accountable for this. One of the things I'm proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way and I'll give him credit Bernie Sanders was a part of this we passed a V.A. accountability bill. And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary because of the law I passed it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren't doing a good job.Senior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn't working. The problem is no one's being held accountable. Even after we passed that law no one's been fired for no outreach. No one's been fired for calls going to the voicemail. No one's been disciplined. No one's been demoted.When I'm president of the United States if you work at the V.A. and you are not doing a good job you will be fired from your job at the V.A. Well I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change. But it will require Cuba to change at least its government. Today it has not. The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made after these changes were made there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime. It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone. They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there. They'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president. And nothing will change for the Cuban people.There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights. In fact things are worse than they were before this opening. The only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.And we asked nothing in return. Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma. And by no means is Burma a perfect country. But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma they were required to make some democratic openings. When there was a diplomatic opening it required democratic opening. And today the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body.He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return. And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions. It's harboring fugitives of American justice including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba all in exchange for nothing. All right first of all the embassy is the former consulate. It's the same building. So it could just go back to being called a consulate. We don't have to close it that way. Second of all I don't know where Cuba is going to use but if they sue us in a court in Miami they're going to lose. Third on the issue of a good deal I know what the good deal. I'll tell you what the good deal now it's already codified. Here's a good deal Cuba has free elections Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out Cuba has freedom of the press Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice including that cop killer from New Jersey and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs. And you know what? Then we can have a relationship with Cuba. That's a good deal. Well sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing. There's never been a time when the climate has not changed. I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so is there a law you can pass to fix it?So on the issue of flooding in Miami it's caused by two things. Number one south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp. And number two because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening we do need to deal with that through mitigation.And I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather there's no such thing. On the contrary there is laws they want us to pass. There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he's forcing down our throats on the war on coal.Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that? Americans are going to pay the price of that. The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer the single parent the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living.The businesses who are going to leave America because it's more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.And you know what passing those laws would have what impact it would have on the environment? Zero because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels. So I am in favor of a clean environment. My children live in South Florida. My family is being raised here. I want this to be a safe and clean place but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy. I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that. If we pass if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them there would be no change in our environment. Sea level would still rise. All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons. One because America is not a planet. It's a country. And number two because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut. Here's what he will immediately and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend but here's what he's going to immediately going to start hearing from.He will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power. That cost will be passed on to working families. I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent. I do. A couple of points. The first is I'm concerned about violence in general in this society. And by the way the first people that are facing that violence are our law enforcement officers. And they deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks for everything they do for us. On the issue of anger. Yes people are angry. Of course they're angry. Every institution in America has been failing us for the better part of 20 years or 30 years. But leadership is not about using the anger leadership is about using the anger to motivate us not to define us. But to motivate us to take action. Being here in Miami is special. My grandfather lived with us most of his life while I was growing up. And he would sit on the porch of our home and tell me all kinds of stories and things I learned about history.My grandfather was born in 1899 before there were airplanes in the sky. One night in the summer of 1969 he watched a man set foot on the moon. You know what he said when he saw that? He said Americans can do anything. Americans can do anything. There is no problem before us we cannot solve and we can solve it if we come together in a serious way in this generation. And embrace all of the principles that made us great. Let me tell you what this election is about for me. And I get all the delegate math and all that debate. Let me tell you what's about for me. On Tuesday night I didn't do as well obviously as I wanted to. And I was a little bit disappointed when I got home. And my wife told me a story that night which is the reason why I can get up the next day and keep fighting. There's a gentleman here in South Florida who just got out of surgery. And his doctors told him he needs to be home resting. But every afternoon he takes his little aluminum chair and he sits outside of an early polling center and holds a sign that says ""Marco Rubio.""Because for him I symbolize all the sacrifices that his generation made so their children could have a better life than themselves That gentleman has not given up on me and I am not going to give up on him. I am going to work tirelessly every single day... ...because this election is too important. What's at stake is the future of this country. And I believe I believe that at the end of this process this nation will make the right choice because I've always believed that God has blessed America that God's hand is upon this country and that its greatest days are yet to come. Well I think you can be flexible about ideas you shouldn't be flexible about your principles. About when it comes to ideas and working with people I have a record of having done that. Listen on the issue of higher education I'm the only one that continually talks about student loan debt because I owed over $100000 of student loan debt. So I know this is a major issue. And all my ideas that deal with higher education are bipartisan.The VA Accountability Act that I passed I did it on a on a bipartisan basis. The sanctions that I helped that I imposed on Hezbollah I did it on a bipartisan basis. The Girls Count Act that deals with human trafficking we did that on a bipartisan basis.But I also want to be frank. There are issues we're going to have to have an election over. When it comes to repealing and replaces Obamacare that's not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to reducing the tax burdens on Americans that's not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracythat's probably not going to be bipartisan.There are issues we can work together on and we should but there are fundamental issues about the proper role of government. And on those issues I will fight anyone who wants to expand government raise taxes or weaken our military. It's great to be here back at home in Miami. It's hard to believe that just two decades ago my father was just a bartender working in the city. And now his son stands on this stage here as a candidate for the highest office in the land. My parents never wanted me to go into politics or in particular or anything else. They just wanted me to have the opportunity to live out all the dreams they once had for themselves. And that was possible because America is a special country. But that was not an accident. America is great because each generation before us did what needed to be done. They solved their problems they confronted their challenges. They embraced their opportunities. And for over two centuries each generation has left the next better off.And now the moment has arrived for our generation to do our part. And I'm telling you tonight if you vote for me here in Florida and everywhere across this country on Tuesday when I'm elected president this generation will do it's part.We will do whatever it takes to ensure that our children inherit from us what we inherited from our parents the single greatest nation in the history of all of mankind."
2016-03-10 00:00:00,cruz," Fifty-nine years ago Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West. He was 18. He was filled with hopes and dreams and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth. This election this debate is not about insults. It's not about attacks. It's not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It's about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America. Actually that's incorrect. There are two different agreements. There's TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade look free trade when we open up foreign markets helps Americans. But we're getting killed in international trade right now. And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We're driving jobs overseas. And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.And you've got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is what's the solution? It's easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things.Number one we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first not the corporate board room. Number two we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America. Well we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn't working. And then on top of that we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally. And the answer to that I've laid out a very very detailed immigration plan on my website. We're going to build a wall triple the border patrol. We're going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we're going to do that.We're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws. We're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand Stephen we can solve these problems. It's not that we don't know how to do it. It's that we're lacking the political will. Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country. We need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country. Common Core is a disaster. And if I am elected president in the first days as president I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day. Now let me tell you why you can do that because it's easy to talk about the problem but you have to understand the solutions. The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.Now the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power and I intend to do that. Beyond that though Jake I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments.And let me say finally the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers and scholarships. And give every child African American Hispanic every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education. Well number one we need to see responsibility. Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency and it's irresponsible. And any politician that doesn't step forward and address it is not being a real leader. We need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security. And as president what I will do for seniors for anyone at or near retirement there will be no changes whatsoever. Every benefit will be protected to the letter. But for younger workers we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dinan we need to have for younger workers that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts like the 401(k) that you own that you control that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids. And one of the things that is critically important. Listen we've got lots of challenges in the world. But the answer can't just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away. You have to understand the problems. You have to have real solutions.It's like government spending. It is very easy. Hillary Clinton says she'll cut waste fraud and abuse. If only we had smarter people in Washington that would fix the problem. You know what? That is the statement of a liberal who doesn't understand government is the problem. Here's my philosophy. The less government the more freedom. The fewer bureaucrats the more prosperity. And there are bureaucrats in... ...Washington right now who are killing jobs and I'll tell you I know who they are. I will find them and I will fire them. I will let Donald speak for himself. But I will say there's a reason in my campaign I've laid out a very very specific spend and cut plan $500 billion. I've specified five major agencies that I would eliminate 25 programs. And Dana you know why political candidates don't do that? Because when you do that the lobbyists attack you. When you specify the programs you would eliminate then you get attacked. Let's talk for example back in Iowa the first primary. When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates everyone said that was political suicide. You can't take on ethanol in Iowa. And my opponents on this stage not only didn't do the same. They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare. If we're going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids you've got to be willing to take on the lobbyists which means not just some fanciful waste fraud and abuse but specifying these are the programs I'll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer. Listen if you are fed up with Washington the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington? It's easy to have language I'm fed up with the corruption in Washington. But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment it's very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington. When I stood up and led the fight against Obamacare Washington was furious and attacked me but I did it because I was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare. When I led the fight against amnesty it's because I was standing with the people... ...against Washington. And if you want to tell people you're going to stand against Washington the question we should ask is when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington? Well Donald is right for example he was just talking about international trade. He's right about the problems. But his solutions don't work. So for example his solution on international trade he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods. Now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight. I don't know where he'll be tonight. But I'll tell you what happens. You know we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs you know Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression.And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store when you go to Walmart when you are shopping for your kids the prices you pay go up 45 percent. But not only that when you put those in place because a tariff is a tax on you the American people but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs.A much better solution that works is the tax plan I've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free would tax our imports would not raise prices for Americans and would not result in reciprocal tariffs. Fix the problem and that's what's missing from what Donald says. Jake let me be clear what Donald just said. He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat. And mind you you are paying the tax. It's not China that pays the tax. It's you the working men and women. So ask yourself at home: How is this helping you? If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills how does it help you to have a president come and say ""I'm going to jack I'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers on automobiles when you buy automobiles on clothing when you buy clothing."" That hurts you.It's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad and actually get to how do you solve the problem. Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America. No of course not. We've never targeted innocent civilians and we're not going to start now. But listen Jake I understand. People are scared and for seven years we've faced terrorist attacks and President Obama lectures Americans on Islamophobia. That is maddening. But the answer is not simply to yell ""China bad Muslims bad."" You've got to understand the nature of the threats we're facing and how you deal with them. And yes it is true there are millions of radical Islamic terrorists who seek to kill us. We need a president commander in chief focused on fighting them.And I'll tell you frankly one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary when you look at his substantive policies on Iran he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal. I think that's a mistake.The Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us. I'll give you another example dealing with Islamic radical terrorism. On Israel Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians.As president I will not be neutral. And let me say this week a Texan Taylor Force. He was an Eagle Scout he was a West Point graduate he was an Army veteran. He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel and I don't think we need a commander in chief... ...who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world the nation of Israel. You know we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country. The reason we are friends and allies with Israel is they are a liberal Democratic country that share our values they're our strongest ally in the region. We get billions in intelligence resources billions in military resources. And the Palestinian Authority that Donald along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they want to treat neutrally the same as Israel. The Palestinian Authority is in a unity government with Hamas a terrorist organization.They pay the families of these terrorists who murder people. And this is exactly the moral relativism Barack Obama has. And the answer is not scream all Muslims bad.Let me give you an example of a Muslim for example we ought to be standing with President el-Sisi of Egypt a president of a Muslim country who is targeting radical... ...Islamic terrorist. He's hunting them down and stomping them. Our focus needs to be on keeping this country safe. We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS. And that's needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment. Right now we're not using a fraction of the tools that we have. We're not using our overwhelming air power. We're not arming the Kurds. Those need to be the first steps. And then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out. But you know a question that actually Jake asked and I'm glad to come back to it now is rules of engagement. We have right now our troops engaged in combat but President Obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back.They're not able to fight. They're not able to defend themselves. They're not able to kill the enemy. And I have got to tell you Hugh I think that is wrong. It is immoral. And I give my word to every soldier sailor and airman and marine and every wife and husband every son and daughter every mother and father that will end in January 2017. Yes I would. And you know I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters. When it comes to foreign policy do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy? When it comes to these deals Cuba and Iran they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. There's a real difference between us. Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they're doing. The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals they should be more effective. I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do that we shouldn't be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us. Well look. I'll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush and he supported Hillary Clinton gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008. And indeed once she was secretary of State he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry. And you know the point on the Iran deal his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government things would be better. No. We don't just need smarter people in government. We need leaders that are protecting American interests. And when it comes to Iran Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion. That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us.We need a commander in chief that understands our enemies... ...understands and doesn't give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security. Of course it does. And we've seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made sadly his administration a laughing stock in the world. This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks. Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America. Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on. I'll tell you when I travel abroad when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers they say over and over again ""it is hard to be friends with America; we can't count on America; America doesn't stand with us.""And that is a disgrace. But the good news is Jake we've seen this before. We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military weaken our readiness weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter. And in January 1981 Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight.It's worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies as I will do and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies. That's why on day one I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal because the Ayatollah Khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. Listen I think for every one of us we need to show respect to the people. We need to remember who it is we're working for. You know we've seen for seven years a president who believes he's above the law who behaves like an emperor who it is all about him and he forgot that he's working for the American people. And let me let me ask turn the camera our here. How many of y'all feel disrespected by Washington? Washington isn't listening to the people. And that's the frustration that is boiling over. And we need to nominate and elects a president who remembers he works for the people. You know at Donald's rallies recently he's taken to asking people in the crowd to raise their hand and pledge their support to him.Now I got to say to me I think that's exactly backwards. This is a job interview. We are here pledging our support to you not the other way around. And the only hand raising I'm interested in doing is on January 20 2017 raising my hand with my left hand on the... ...bible and pledging to the American people to preserve protect and defend the constitution of United States. Well look there are some folks in Washington... Donald you are welcome to be president of the Smithsonian. You know there are some in Washington who are having fevered dreams of a brokered convention. They are unhappy with how the people are voting and they want to parachute in their favored Washington candidate to be the nominee. I think that would be an absolute disaster and we need to respect the will of the voters. It's one of the reasons why in the course of this election listen everyone up here has worked very hard. But Donald is right there are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination Donald and myself. At this point I have roughly 360 delegates. He has about 100 more than I have. We have at this point beaten Donald in eight separate states all over the country geographically from Maine to Alaska from Kansas to Texas all over this country we have beaten him.And so for the people at home if you're one of the 65 70 percent of Republicans who recognizes that if we nominate Donald Trump Hillary wins. That's why the media wants him to be the nominee so much. If you recognize that then I want to invite you if you've supported other candidates come and join us.We are seeing candidates coming together and uniting. It's why Carly Fiorina endorsed me yesterday. It's why Mike Lee endorsed me today. I ask everyone to come together. Let's stand together and let's beat Hillary Clinton in November. Well look absolutely. And one of the things we're so frustrated about is the corruption what I've called the Washington cartel. It's career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests. And listen Donald told you for 40 years he's been sitting at that table using his money to buy influence supporting liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry but also supporting the Republican establishment and funding their effort to crush the Tea Party. And now his argument is after four decades of being part of that influence buying after Hillary Clinton spending decades being part of that influence selling that suddenly he will change.But the interesting point is tonight he hasn't pointed to a single special interest he's willing to take on. He didn't take on Wall Street when he supported the TARP bailout in Wall Street. He won't take on ethanol. And my campaign by contrast was funded by 1.1 million contributions all over this country. $62 at tedcruz.org. That's who you've got to be accountable to the people. What an incredible nation we have that the son of a bartender and the son of mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman can all stand on this stage competing and asking for your support. In just a few months one of us is going to stand on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton. And the choice we are making today is who will best defend our values? Who will best defend your values and fight for you?I have to tell you I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton and say ""Madam Secretary you are asking for a third term of a failed administration. You are asking for millions more to remain in stagnant jobs; for millions more steelworkers to be out of work; for wages to remain low; for young people not to have a future.""We can do better. We can instead repeal Obamacare abolish the IRS unleash millions of jobs defend the Bill of Rights defend the Second Amendment and religious liberty stand with our cops and our firefighters and our soldiers and we can keep America safe.That's the choice I will put to her this fall."
2016-03-10 00:00:00,kasich," Well thank you. You know I look in the faces of people all across this country and I know they want to be hopeful. And many are hopeful. Look I can take conservative policies to the White House to Washington to restore the strength of our economy. But I also want to transfer power money and influence to where you live because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods the families the communities and our states. And I believe it's a new partnership a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we've ever had.Thank you. Well Jake I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it. But my position has always been we want to have free trade but fair trade. And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says ""Oh America was right"" and people are out of work.The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat when countries cheat and they take advantage of us we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.But we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly if we do that prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don't want to see that happen.Trade though has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation like some country dumping their products into this country believe me as president I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up.And Jake my family worked in the steel industry not with a white collar. I understand their plight. Well look I believe in immigration but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here. I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration. Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can't have people just walking in. Look we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So we I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can't continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program where people come in work and go home.And I think at the same time for the 11 and a half million who are here then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.But let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation lower taxes and a balanced budget.We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America all the people who are citizens of America if we'll just follow the formula that works that I used in Washington. And guess what I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor Well look all I'm in favor of in Ohio is high standards. First of all let me tell you I would take 125 federal education programs put them in four buckets and send them back to the states. OK I've been working on this for many many years. Secondly Jake in our state the state school board sets the standards. And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards unfortunately. They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.Not only did we have that in the law we reasserted it in the law. And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that in fact you know frankly education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state.Now on top of that you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids? We need to start connecting them to the real world. We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century not the jobs of 20 years ago.We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs.Frankly what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion. And that's exactly what we're doing in Ohio combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be.So let me be clear local control obviously high state standards. That's what it is in the state of Ohio. Well first of all we hear about taking on Washington. I took on Washington and I won. I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress the chairman of the budget committee. We paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt. We also balanced the budget four years in a row. And we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then. I also had a plan in 1999 to save Social Security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have Social Security for our young people but also to give them private accounts. Now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous.I have a plan to fix it that doesn't even require raising the retirement age.If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime when the time comes to be on Social Security you'll still get it. It will just simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security they'll get their full benefit. That's the way it will work. And we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age. And how do I know that? I've done all this before.This is not a theory. Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? Yes. It doesn't mean you have to cut them. It means you need to innovate them the way we do things in the 21st Century.So not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington but when I went to Ohio we were $8 billion in the hole and now we're $2 billion in the black. Our credit is strong. We're up 400000 jobs. And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again.And I will get it done and this country will be much stronger economically as a result. No I don't. I think there is a sect of you know this radical Islam that is really really serious and poses the greatest threat to us today. There isn't any question. And that's why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don't have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction. But look I was there when and saw it when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. The fact is that if we're going to defeat ISIS we're going to have to have these countries. And they are Egypt. And they are Saudi Arabia. And they are Jordan. And they are the Gulf states.And we're going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey. And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe. The simple fact of the matter is a lot of these Muslim countries they are just they can't believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith.Look the people who represent radical Islam they want to destroy everything that we're about and other Muslims who don't share their view. But at the end of the day we've got to bring the world together the civilized world. And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is and we represent it and equality and hope for everybody. Well there's no question. They were saying that the Israelis intended to go to the Dome of the Rock. And I mean when you think about this thank goodness we work with Israelis to give them the Iron Dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in. Could you imagine living in like Miami here and having people shooting missiles in? Secondly there was just an article the other day Hugh that I know you're familiar with the Israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the Palestinians now Hamas in particular is digging these tunnels trying to get under Israel. They're coming at them from above they're trying to come at them under the ground.And I just have to tell you this I don't believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution. And I think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do. I believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the Israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the Middle East in regard to Israel. Hugh I've said all along and laid out my foreign policy I'm going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said I was the best to be commander-in- chief. I spent 18 years on the Defense Committee Armed Services and then I was in the Pentagon with Donald Rumsfeld after 9/11 in and out for a couple of years. We absolutely have to win this with a coalition. Arabs have to be with us. The Europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer is as close as it is to us. And in addition to that you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground.And you bring all the force you need. It has got to be ""shock and awe"" in the military-speak. Then once it gets done and we will wipe them out once it gets done it settles down we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that's what it takes. I don't I haven't seen the provisions of that bill Jake. My initial instincts are no. And let me just say about the V.A. When a veteran comes home they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time number one. Number two the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured. It needs to be downsized and spread out. It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans.And secondly the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans' service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home they can be linked with a job.And when that happens that means that every veteran will get work because they're our golden employees. No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America. No I wouldn't. Listen I think the problem with the administration if you talk to our friends around the world they say what is America doing? You know you don't support us we can't figure out where you are. You won't arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people. You had a red line in Syria. You walked away from it. You refused to fund the Syrian rebels you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile.And then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal. Look I know in human nature sometimes there's a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends. And you know what happens when you do that? You make a terrible mistake.You need to support your friends you need to hold your enemies out here... ...and you need to negotiate tough deals. The fact is they need to understand who we are. The Chinese understand. They don't own the South China Sea. They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we'll take out their systems. We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid.We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin you better understand you're either with us or you're against us. We're not rattling a sword. You're not our enemy but we're not going to put up with this nonsense any longer.And a strong America is what the entire world is begging for. Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world. When I'm president they're going to know exactly where we are because we're coming back. Well I I do believe we contribute to climate change but I don't think it has to be a you know either you're for some environmental stringent rules or you know you're not going to have any jobs. The fact is you can have both. In our state we've reduced emissions by 30 percent. But let me tell you also what we're trying to do. We want all the sources of energy. We want to dig coal but we want to clean it when we burn it. We believe in natural gas. We believe in nuclear power.And you know what else I believe in? I happen to believe in solar energy wind energy efficiency renewables matter.Now it doesn't mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment because we don't know how much humans actually contribute. But it is important we develop renewables. Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world.So the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another. I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids. And when that guy stood in front that young man stood in front of that tank we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government. Now I will tell you I don't believe that we need to make China an enemy. They are a competitor. But I want to go back to three things they should do. We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he's doing number one.Number two they need to realize they don't own the South China Sea. And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea. And thirdly when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks we're going to have to beef up the cyber command.And they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves everything including our grid. But if you do it we have the capability to take out your systems. The president has not given the cyber command that authority. I will.And when it comes to trade I will tell you this they can't manipulate their currency. That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with. And if I saw them doing it I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected. Well I worry about the violence at a rally period. I mean it's you know elections are important but the unity of this country really matters. Jake here's what I think is happening. There are people out there who are worried about their jobs. They're worried that somebody is going to come in and tell them they're out of work and they're 54 years old and they don't know where they're going to get another job a man and a woman.Maybe they're worried about a trade deal. They're worried about the fact that their wages haven't gone up. They're worried that their kids went to college and the promise was you go to college you get a job things are going to be great.They went to college they rang up debt and they're still living in their parents' basement. People are uptight. Our seniors are worried they're going to lose their Social Security. There's two ways to treat it.You can either prey on that and be negative about it or you tell people that these things can be fixed. If we're Americans rather than Republicans and Democrats we get together we can solve all of these problems.We can provide financial security we can drive the wages up we can get kids jobs with a more robust economy. And you know what? They want to help solve these problems right where they live and I'll give them the power to do it. Well first of all let's not you know math doesn't tell the whole story in politics. The great thing about politics the reason why we watch it is because what's true today is not necessarily true tomorrow. So let's not get ahead of ourselves. Secondly look when you went to school up there in Salem Ohio OK. If you got an 86 you got a B. Because everybody else had an 84 didn't mean you got an A. So you just have to win enough delegates to be the nominee.And frankly I don't know if we're going to get a convention like that. But if we do I was at one in 1976 as a wee lad and supported Ronald Reagan and actually worked directly with him. He tried valiantly. He lost. Gerald Ford won. The party was united. Gerald Ford served the country great by pardoning Richard Nixon. He lost the election probably because of that but he put America first. And we were healed as a party.So look you have to earn the delegates in order to be picked. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. We don't know what's going to happen because we still have about half the delegates to be selected. And that's what's going to be a very interesting thing to see how it all turns out as we move forward over the next couple of weeks. Well look my record speaks for itself. What I talk about tonight is not a theory. These are things that I've done. I was there when we reformed the Pentagon on a bipartisan basis to give control to the commanders in the field and force the services to work together. I was the chief architect along with Senator Domenici of the last time we balanced the budget and the first time since we walked on the moon. I was there when I worked on the welfare reform in Washington. And we got it done and we eliminated the entitlement on welfare I then went to Ohio and took Ohio from a basket case working in a bipartisan basis to reform many things including the Cleveland public schools working with a Democratic mayor.My problem isn't that people don't know this. They say well what does that mean? Does that mean you're too easy? Well let me tell you when we did the balanced budget we cut the capital gains tax we provided a family tax credit we shrunk the government.In my state the state of Ohio has the smallest government in the state of Ohio in 30 years. Conservative principles will work. But show respect to the other side.One final thing in regard to Social Security we will not get that done alone. We will have to have some responsible Democrats who will come in to fix the problem of Social Security. I know how to do it because I've done it and I'll do it again. Well I'd like to say to all of you the American people I have run an unwavering positive campaign for president of the United States. I have tried to be positive in such a way as to show my record my accomplishments my vision. And I wanted to raise the bar in presidential politics so our kids can take a look at the way you can run for president and you will someday maybe be president of the United States.Sometimes being positive isn't all that interesting but it's very interesting to my family my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country and I will continue to run a positive campaign.I can fix the problems in Washington I've done it before. And in fact I want to turn power money and influence back to you the American people so that you can be in the schools and on the streets fighting drugs and dealing with the issues of poverty. We can do this together.Allow me to take care of the federal issues when I send the power back and the money and the influence to you and you can strengthen our nation and our neighborhoods and our families. That's where the spirit and strength of America is.But ask the people my friends in Illinois and of course my beloved Buckeyes to consider me on Tuesday and please let me have your vote. God bless."
2016-03-10 00:00:00,hewitt," Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump. we're going to come to you in a second but wait. I want to go to Hugh Hewitt who has questions on this exact line of subject.Mr. Trump I want to follow-up on the quote that Senator Cruz used. You said you would want to be quote ""sort of a neutral guy"". He did mention Taylor Force. He was a West Point graduate he was a war hero. He was a Vanderbilt graduate student.He was killed in a Palestinian terror attack near Tel Aviv many others were killed. And the Israeli government says the Palestinian authority is inciting this. Do you still want to stay neutral when the Palestinian authority is inciting these attacks. Senator Trump... Thank you Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio. Senator Rubio. Thank you. I want to go back to the Israeli government's assertion that the Palestinian Authority is inciting the convulsion of violence. Do you agree. Mr. Trump and then I'll come to you Senator Kasich. Thank you senator. Mr. Trump a response and then we'll go to Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich do you agree the Israeli government that the Palestinian Authority is inciting this violence? Thank you Governor. Senator Cruz I want to stay in the region. Just this week the head of U.S. Central Command General General Lloyd Austin essentially said it's going to take a lot more troops on the ground to fix to end the ISIS threat in Syria and Iraq. From the beginning of this campaign you have said you will follow the judgment of military commanders in the Pentagon. So here's the commander saying we need a lot more troops on the ground. Will you follow that advice and inject Americans again into what is in essence is metastasizing Sunni-Shia civil war? Governor Kasich if it takes 20000 or 30000 if the Pentagon says that's what needs to be done will you follow their advice? Mr. Trump more troops? How many... Thank you Jake. Governor Kasich the math and the maps say that you can only become the nominee if in fact there is a contested convention. If we arrive on the shores of Lake Erie Donald Trump has the most delegates. Why shouldn't the person with the most delegates even if it's not a majority of delegates be the nominee? Thank you Governor. Mr. Trump if you arrive in Cleveland with a plurality and the most but not a majority is it legitimate for someone else to emerge from that convention the nominee? And if so would you support that person? Senator Cruz if you if you overtake Donald Trump at the convention what will you do to take his very passionate supporters and keep them from bolting the convention and sabotaging the fall election? All right. Thank you Senator. Mr. Trump then to Senator Rubio. Senator Rubio?"
2016-03-10 00:00:00,bash," Senator Rubio you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable. For people under 55 you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans. So what should the new retirement age be? And how much will those benefits be cut? Senator the question was specific though. You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits? Mr. Trump you don't want to raise the retirement age and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans. But according to the Social Security Administration unless adjustments are made Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. So specifically what would you do to stop that from happening? Senator Rubio I know you want to get in. Hang on one second I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump. You're talking about waste fraud and abuse but an independent bipartisan organization the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget says improper payments like you're talking about that would only save about $3 billion but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent. So how would you find that other $147 million? Senator Rubio will that be enough to save Social Security? Mr. Trump Senator Rubio says your numbers don't add up. What's your response? Senator Rubio says that your numbers don't add up. What's your response Mr. Trump? Thank you Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz you advocate allowing younger workers to put some of their Social Security taxes into personal accounts. What do you say to critics who say that market volatility means that this is a disastrous proposal? Did you justice just compare Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton on this issue? Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump would you like to respond? Senator Cruz? OK. Mr. Trump I'll let you respond because he mentioned you but then I'm going to move to Governor Kasich. Go ahead. Governor Kasich let's get back to Social Security. You told a voter in New Hampshire to quote ""Get over cuts to Social Security benefits"" because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there. Why is cutting Social Security payments the solution? Senator Rubio Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba. The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well. So why are President Obama Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong? Mr. Trump you said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. You said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. Why do you agree with President Obama and disagree with what Senator Rubio just said? Senator Rubio I know you want to get in. But just to be clear Mr. Trump are you saying that if you were president you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them? But Mr. Trump just to be clear there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it. Which would it be? In Havana. Thank you Senator Rubio. Senator Cruz if you become president would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba? Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz your response? Thank you Mr. Trump. Let's refocus this back on Cuba. Governor Kasich a pair of entrepreneurs from Alabama and North Carolina have just received approval to build the first U.S. factory in Cuba making tractor for small farms. This is a direct result of President Obama's policy in Cuba that we've been talking about. If you were elected would you encourage more U.S. companies to do business like that in Cuba?"
2016-03-10 00:00:00,moderators, Jake Tapper (CNN); Dana Bash (CNN); Hugh Hewitt (Salem Radio Network); and Stephen Dinan (Washington Times)
2015-11-10 00:00:00,bartiromo," Tonight we're partnering with the Wall Street Journal to ask questions on the economy that voters want answered. We're also working with Facebook who tells us that since the first Republican debate more than 58 million people have joined the political conversation online. More than 9 million are talking specifically about the economy. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina. Ohio Governor John Kasich. And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. We've asked people on Facebook to submit their questions for the candidates. Seth Bell wrote ""We are approaching $20 trillion in national debt. Specifically what plans do you have to cut federal spending?"" Governor Kasich you have spoken much about your success in balancing the budget under President Clinton. Today the national debt is at record highs and growing unsustainably. Interest will be the fastest-growing part of the federal budget tripling over the next 10 years. Social Security the lifeline of millions of American seniors is rushing toward insolvency. With all of the tax plans presented tonight estimated to cost anywhere between $2 trillion and $12 trillion over a decade what specific steps will you take to balance the budget? Did you want to name any specific steps sir? Thank you sir. Senator Cruz the International Monetary Fund recently cut its expectations for economic growth. Many economists expect a recession to hit the U.S. within the next year due to the weakening of manufacturing. The next president will have to deal with it. You say tax reform is a powerful lever to spur economic expansion. You're calling for a 10 percent income tax and a 16 percent business tax. What other elements do you need in this plan to actually create jobs? Thank you sir. Governor Bush... We have more questions for you Governor Kasich coming up. We have more questions for you Governor Kasich. We will we will certainly get to that. Governor Bush? Almost 40 percent of Americans are without a job and are not looking. Many have given up. That's what the participation rate tells us. You've said your policies will drive the economy back to 4 percent growth which we haven't seen since the year 2000. What specific regulations would you change? And how will that lead to jobs and growth? Thank you sir. Mr. Trump a federal appeals court just dealt a blow to the Obama administration's plan to prevent the deportation of 5 million people living in this country illegally. The White House is appealing to the Supreme Court. At the heart of this issue is the effect that illegal immigrants are having on our economy what will you do about it? Can we just send 5 million people back with no effect on economy? So what will you do? Thank you sir. We go back to Facebook. Dewayne Wesley Cato asks on Facebook how do we get rid of regulations choking our businesses? Ms. Fiorina? Specifically under the president's Affordable Care Act employers with 50 or more employees are required to offer health insurance or be fined. Many are opting to pay the fine. Others are cutting back employee hours to duck the law altogether. What specific ways will you alleviate the pressure on small business? Just to be clear you want to repeal Obamacare... ..but what's the alternative? Just to be clear you say you would repeal Obamacare... ...But what is the alternative... ...and how does that help small business... ...Thank you... Senator Cruz there isn't anyone in this audience or watching at home tonight who would not like to pay less in taxes. Most people just want a fair shake and they don't want their money to be wasted. But explain how your plan works. How can you cut taxes as much as you propose without running up debt and deficits? But you haven't told us how to pay for it. Thank you Senator. Governor Bush Republican primary voters say tax reform should be a priority for Congress and the administration. But Governor Bush how important is tax reform in your domestic policy agenda? Will you guarantee it in the first year of your presidency? Thank you Governor. That's right. That's right. Coming up the biggest threats facing the next commander-in-chief. You're watching the Republican presidential debate live tonight from Milwaukee. We'll be right back. Welcome back. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate. The candidates taking the questions you want answered. Also tonight you can see what America is saying about the debate. Go to Facebook and type #gopdebate into the search box. Now back to the questions. Americans face security threats at home and abroad. Last year terrorist attacks rose 61 percent according to the Institute for Economics and Peace with the most deaths occurring in just five countries Iraq Afghanistan Pakistan Nigeria and Syria.Dr. Carson you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan. Do you support the president's decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan? We asked Facebook to take a look at some of the major issues we're talking about and tackling in this debate tonight. This word cloud shows what people are focusing on the most. The bigger the word the more the talk. One of the most discussed issues in the last month homeland security. Governor Bush what is the biggest threat facing America today? Thank you sir. Mr. Trump in 2012 debate President Obama mocked Mitt Romney's assertion that Russia was the top geopolitical challenge facing the United States saying he was a Cold War dinosaur. Now Russia has invaded Ukraine and has put troops in Syria. You have said you will have a good relationship with Mr. Putin. So what does President Trump do in response to Russia's aggression? Thank you sir. Thank you governor. Senator Rubio. Thank you Governor Kasich. More questions more questions coming up when the Republican presidential debate comes right back live from Milwaukee. Stay with us. Welcome back to the fourth Republican presidential debate. Senator Rubio Hillary Clinton is the clear front runner for the Democratic nomination. If she is indeed the nominee you will be facing a candidate with an impressive resume.She was the first lady of the United States a U.S. senator from New York and secretary of state under Barack Obama. She has arguably more experience certainly more time in government than almost all of you on stage tonight.Why should the American people trust you to lead this country even though she has been so much closer to the office? Senator Paul you were one of 15 republicans to vote for an amendment which states that human activity contributed to climate change. President Obama has announced an aggressive plan to cut carbon emissions. At the same time energy production in America has boomed. Is it possible to continue this boom and move toward energy self-sufficiency while at the same time pursuing a meaningful climate change program? Carly Fiorina? Former Governor Jeb Bush? Senator Ted Cruz? He's funny. Thank you."
2015-11-10 00:00:00,trump," I can't be Neil. And the and the reason I can't be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically militarily. There is nothing that we do now to win. We don't win anymore. Our taxes are too high. I've come up with a tax plan that many many people like very much. It's going to be a tremendous plan. I think it'll make our country and our economy very dynamic. But taxes too high wages too high we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we can not do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can't do it. I would not do it. I was so happy yesterday when I saw that decision come down. That was an unbelievable decision. And we don't have enough of those decisions coming down. He of the executive order because nobody wants to listen to him including the Democrats so he just goes around signing executive orders. That was a great day. And frankly we have to stop illegal immigration. It's hurting us economically. It's hurting us from every standpoint. It's causing tremendous difficulty with respect to drugs and what that does to many of our inner cities in particular.And it really is was such an unbelievable moment because the courts have not been ruling in our favor. And it was a 2-1 decision. And it was a terrific thing that happened. And I will tell you we are a country of laws. We need borders. We will have a wall. The wall will be built. The wall will be successful. And if you think walls don't work all you have to do is ask Israel. The wall works believe me. Properly done. Believe me. You are going to have to bring people you are going to have to send people out. Look we're a country... Maria we're a country of laws. We either have a country or we don't have a country. We are a country of laws. Going to have to go out and they will come back but they are going to have to go out and hopefully they get back. But we have no choice if we're going to run our country properly and if we're going to be a country. All I can say is you're lucky in Ohio that you struck oil. That is for one thing. Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower good president great president people liked him. ""I like Ike"" right? The expression. ""I like Ike."" Moved a 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again beyond the border they came back. Didn't like it. Moved them way south. They never came back. Dwight Eisenhower. You don't get nicer. You don't get friendlier. They moved a 1.5 million out. We have no choice. We have no choice. No it's unfair. ... built an unbelievable company worth billions and billions of dollars. I don't have to hear from this man believe me. I don't have to hear from him. We have millions of people right now on line trying to come into this country. Very very unfair to the people that want to come into our country legally. They've gone through the process. They're on line. They're waiting. Very very unfair to them. That I can tell you. Yes. No I'm sorry. No excuse me. I was there. Please if I could just... We have to make our military bigger better stronger than ever before so that nobody messes with us and a long run it's going to save us. I agree with Marco I agree with Ted we have no choice. And I can tell you this with certainty. We all have a different tax plan. Some I don't totally agree with. One thing we understand each one of those tax plans is better than the mess that we have right now. ...Yes... ...Yeah... ...It's a horrible deal... The TPP is horrible deal. It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble. It's a deal that was designed for China to come in as they always do through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. It's 5600 pages long. So complex that nobodies read it. It's like Obamacare; nobody ever read it. They passed it; nobody read it. And look at mess we have right now. And it will be repealed. But this is one of the worst trade deals. And I would yes rather not have it. With all of these countries and all of the bad ones getting advantage and taking advantage of what the good ones would normally get I'd rather make individual deals with individual countries. We will do much better. We lose a fortune on trade. The United States loses with everybody. We're losing now over $500 billion in terms of imbalance with China $75 billion a year imbalance with Japan. By the way Mexico $50 billion a year imbalance.So I must say Gerard I just think it's a terrible deal. I love trade. I'm a free trader 100 percent. But we need smart people making the deals and we don't have smart people making the deals. Yes. Well the currency manipulation they don't discuss in the agreement which is a disaster. If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States China in particular because they're so good. It's the number-one abuser of this country. And if you look at the way they take advantage it's through currency manipulation. It's not even discussed in the almost 6000-page agreement. It's not even discussed. And as you understand I mean you understand very well from the Wall Street Journal currency manipulation is the single great weapon people have. They don't even discuss it in this agreement. So I say it's a very bad deal should not be approved. If it is approved it will just be more bad trade deals more loss of jobs for our country. We are losing jobs like nobody's ever lost jobs before. I want to bring jobs back into this country. Well first of all it's not only Russia. We have problems with North Korea where they actually have nuclear weapons. You know nobody talks about it we talk about Iran and that's one of the worst deals ever made. One of the worst contracts ever signed ever in anything and it's a disgrace. But we have somebody over there a madman who already has nuclear weapons we don't talk about that. That's a problem. China is a problem both economically in what they're doing in the South China Sea I mean they are becoming a very very major force. So we have more than just Russia. But as far as the Ukraine is concerned and you could Syria as far as Syria I like if Putin wants to go in and I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes we were stablemates and we did very well that night.But you know that.But if Putin wants to go and knocked the hell out of ISIS I am all for it 100% and I can't understand how anybody would be against it... ...They blew up hold it.... ...They blew up wait a minute... ...They blew up a Russian airplane. He cannot be in love with these people. He's going in and we can go in and everybody should go in. As far as the Ukraine is concerned we have a group of people and a group of countries including Germany tremendous economic behemoth why are we always doing the work? We are I'm all for protecting Ukraine and working but we have countries that are surrounding the Ukraine that aren't doing anything. They say ""Keep going keep going you dummies keep going. Protect us..."" ...And we have to get smart. We can't continue to be the policeman of the world. We are $19 trillion dollars we have a country that's going to hell we have an infrastructure that's falling apart. Our roads our bridges our schools our airports and we have to start investing money in our country. Assad is a bad guy but we have no idea who the so-called rebels I read about the rebels nobody even knows who they are. I spoke to a general two weeks ago he said he was very up on exactly what we're talking about. He said ""You know Mr. Trump? We're giving hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment to these people we have no idea who they are."" So I don't like Assad. Who's going to like Assad? But we have no idea who these people and what they're going to be and what they're going to represent. They may be far worse than Assad. Look at Libya. Look at Iraq. Look at the mess we have after spending $2 trillion dollars thousands of lives wounded warriors all over the place who I love OK? All over. We have nothing. And I said keep the oil. And we should have kept the oil believe me. We should have kept the oil. And you know what? We should have given the oil... ..We should've given big chunks to the people that lost their arms their legs and their families and their sons and daughters because right now you know who has a lot of that oil? Iran and ISIS. Why does she keep interrupting everybody? Terrible. We are not. ...No no no... Well what's happening right now Neil is something that not been a subject of conversation by politicians. As primarily the only politician I guess other than Carly on the stage they haven't talked about a corporate inversion. A corporate inversion companies are leaving. You know we used to leave New York to go to Florida. We got better taxes we got maybe something else. Now they're the United States to go to other countries. They have trillions of dollars in those other countries. They're going for two reasons they can't get their money back in. It's something where the democrats and the republicans both agree it's the only thing I can think of. They both agree let the money come back in.Three and a half years they still can't make a deal. They can't get the money in. It's probably two and a half trillion but I think it's much more than that. All of that money could become could come right in and be used to rebuild our country and investments in our country. They can't do it. What we have to do and what I've done is made the tax rate and one of the reasons they don't the taxes so obnoxious they can't do it.Where I made it a 10% number as you know. I've been very highly praised for it. A lot of money's going to come back in we're going to get rid of the bureaucratic problems and roadblocks because that's also a problem. And we're going to have all of this money pour back into the United States. It's going to be used to build businesses for jobs and everything else.And as I say my expression is let's make America great again. Thank you. Over the years I've created tens of thousands of jobs and a great company. It's a company I'm very proud of. Some of the most iconic assets anywhere in the world. And I will tell you I don't have to give you a website because I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm putting up my own money. I want to do something really special. I want to make our country greater than it's ever been. I think we have that potential. We cannot lose this election. We cannot let Hillary Clinton who is the worst secretary of state in the history of our country win this election.We will fight. We will win. And we truly will make this even more special. We have to make it better than ever before. And I will tell you the United States can actually be better than ever before. Thank you."
2015-11-10 00:00:00,unknown, If you're not going to have my back I'm going to have my back. A couple things here. First of all... We have grown we have grown... True. It's true. ...let me follow up that...  Oh great.
2015-11-10 00:00:00,baker, The candidates on stage tonight were selected based on their standing in an average of four national polls. Those standings determining their position on the stage. And here they are. At center stage businessman Donald Trump. Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson. Tonight's rules are simple. Up to 90 second for each answer. One minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over their allotted time you'll here this. Ms. Fiorina while you've all pointed out how weak the current recovery has been and how disappointing by any historical standards in the general election the Democrats will inevitably ask you and voters to compare the recent president's jobs performance. Now in seven years under President Obama the U.S. has added an average of 107000 jobs a month. Under President Clinton the economy added about 240000 jobs a month. Under George W. Bush it was only 13000 a month. If you win the nomination you'll probably be facing a Democrat named Clinton. How are you going to respond to the claim that Democratic presidents are better at creating jobs than Republicans? Thank you. Thank you. Senator Paul income inequality has been rising in the United States. Fifty years ago for example the average CEO of a big corporation in this country earned 20 times the average salary of one of his or her workers. Today that CEO earns about 300 times the average salary of a worker. Does it matter at all that the gap between the rich and everyone else is widening? Thank you Senator. Senator Rubio... Yes one quick comment yes. Governor Bush... Governor Governor you...You should let Jeb speak. Mr. Trump Mr. Trump you yourself you yourself said let Governor Bush speak. Governor Bush? Senator Rubio? Senator... Senator Rubio Senator Rubio let me let me take you to a question that I think gets to the root of a lot of the anxiety that people have in this country. The economy is undergoing a transformation through information technology. Americans are anxious that the new economy isn't producing higher-paying jobs. Many are concerned that the new wealth seems to be going mainly to innovators and investors. Meanwhile with factories run by robots and shopping done increasingly on smartphones many traditional jobs are just going away. How do you reassure American workers that their jobs are not being steadily replaced by machines? Thank you. Senator Cruz Senator Cruz entitlements. You've argued for raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for future retirees but reducing any sort of benefits for the elderly has always been notoriously hard to do politically. When Speaker Paul Ryan proposed replacing traditional Medicare with federally funded private plans a few years ago a liberal group responded with a commercial that featured a granny being pushed off a cliff. What's going to be different this time? ...I said for future retirees was your statement... Senator Rubio. Can I just come to Senator Rubio? We're coming to you Mr. Trump in one second. I I promise. Senator Rubio your tax plan includes a large expansion of child tax credits to raise off (ph) the tax incomes for low-income parents. A similar tax credit that you previously proposed in the Senate was estimated to cost as much as $170 billion a year according to the Tax Foundation. Isn't isn't there a risk you're just adding another expensive entitle program to an already overburdened federal budget? Governor Kasich? Let me come to Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich. Very quickly Senator. Please. ...Gentleman we need to move on... ...We need to move... ...We need too... ...We do need to move on. Mr. Trump... ...Very quick. Let's talk about No no Governor I really must move on. I really want to move on. Mr. Trump let's talk about the international economy... ...We really need to move on... ...No governor I promise I will come to you... ...Listen... ...Mr. Trump can I ask you about... ...the U.S. just concluded an international trade agreement with 11 countries in the Pacific. You've said that you'd rather have no deal... ...than sign the one that's on the table... ...Most economists most economists say that trade is boosted growth and every single post war president has supported the expansion of international trade including the last three republican presidents. Why would you reverse more than 50 years of U.S. trade policy? The the deal as you say the terms of the deal were published were published just last week the details 5000 pages of it and 80 percent of U.S. trade with countries in the Pacific these countries these 11 countries is actually tariff-free and these the trade deal only affects the other 20 percent. Which are there particular parts of the deal that you think were badly negotiated? There was a separate separate... But isn't that isn't that part of the problem? When I say Senator that if if this deal is not ratified by by the U.S. by the Senate then it would actually give China an opportunity to grow its economic leadership which it's been seeking to do? And if the U.S. is unable to take part in this trade deal with these countries in Asia China will take the lead? Thank you. Thanks Senator. Thank you Senator. Governor Kasich I want to ask you about China in particular hundreds of American companies have been subjected to cyber attacks from the Chinese military yet state-backed Chinese companies growing their presence in the United States Chinese investments in U.S. which were nearly nonexistent a few years ago are now over $50 billion. And as my newspaper recently reported Chinese companies are planning to bid for one of the largest hotel chains in the United States what would be the largest ever Chinese takeover of a U.S. company. Would you stop them? Thank you Governor. Plenty of opportunities. Thank you. Neil? Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from Milwaukee. Now let's get straight back to the questions and Governor Bush.Governor Hillary Clinton recently said that if we had another financial crisis like the one in 2008 she wouldn't bail out the banks. Would you? But Governor but can I just quickly did you can't seriously guarantee that there won't be another financial crisis can you? Ever? There will never be another financial crisis? Dr. Carson if I may just on that point despite measures taken as the governor says since the crisis to make the financial system safer the major banks in the U.S. many of them are actually bigger than ever. Asset held by JPMorgan Chase for example the very largest bank have increased by nearly 40 percent to over $2.6 trillion. Do you think JPMorgan and the other big banks should be broken up? But just to be clear just just to be clear then you wouldn't you wouldn't favor breaking up the big banks? You think they're big enough they're OK as they are as big as they are? Thank you Dr. Carson. Thank you. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate. And now candidates it's time for your closing statements. You get 30 seconds each and Senator Paul we will begin with you. Thank you Senator. Governor Kasich?
2015-11-10 00:00:00,bush," You've already made two comments John. It's my turn. I got about four minutes in the last debate. I'm going to get my question right now. Yes. First of all we could get to 4 percent growth. The new normal of 2 percent puts huge demands on government. The reason why we have structural deficits is that more and more people are relying on government and the growth that we don't have makes makes the deficit grow. A 4 percent growth strategy starts with tax reform. And the proposal that I've laid out is the one the Wall Street Journal editorial board has said is the most pro-growth of all the proposals out there. We cut the we eliminate a lot of deductions and cut the rates down. A corporate rate of 20 percent which puts us 5 percent above below that of China and allows us full expensing of investing. It would create an explosion of investment back into this country creating higher-wage jobs and so that's part of it.On the regulatory side I think we need to repeal every rule that Barack Obama has in terms of work in progress every one of them. And start over. For those that are already in existence the regulation of the Internet we have to start over but we ought to do that.The clean power act we ought to repeal that and and start over on that. The waters of the United States act which is going to be devastating for agriculture and many industries we should repeal that. We should repeal the rules because the economic costs of this far exceed the social benefit. And if we're serious about being serious about high growth then we have to recognize that small businesses right now more of them are closing than than are than are being set up. Hillary Clinton has said that Barack Obama's policies get an A. Really? One in 10 people right now aren't working or have given up altogether as you said. That's not an A. One in seven people are living in poverty. That's not an A. One in five children are on food stamps. That is not an A. It may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do but it's not the best America can do. Thank you Donald for allowing me to speak at the debate. That's really nice of you. Really appreciate that. What a generous man you are. Twelve million illegal immigrants to send them back 500000 a month is just not not possible. And it's not embracing American values. And it would tear communities apart. And it would send a signal that we're not the kind of country that I know America is.And even having this conversation sends a powerful signal they're doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this. That's the problem with this. We have to win the presidency. And the way you win the presidency is to have practical plans. Lay them out there. What we need to do is allow people to earn legal status where they pay a fine where they work where they don't commit crimes where they learn English and over an extended period of time they earn legal status. That's the path a proper path... I'm gonna fight as hard as I can to make sure that we shift power away from Washington simplify the tax code to spur economic activity in this country. Of course it's the highest priority. If we don't do that we're stuck with the ""new normal"" of 2 percent growth. Hillary Clinton says basically we just gotta get used to it. Two percent growth means declining income for the middle class. It means more than 6 million people are stuck in poverty than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated.It means it means more demands on government growing the economy is the first job if we're going to be serious about dealing with the deficit and debt. And more importantly people are really struggling right now.In this economy the disposable income of the great middle is down 2300 bucks. So yeah we've created jobs your argue (ph) brought that up early and it was a good question. Jobs are being created but they're lower-income jobs than the jobs that were lost.And the net effect of this is we need to jump-start the economy. I think of Jonathan (ph) and Reagan Love (ph) who are supporters of mine. Jonathan has been deployed by the National Guard he is he's in Oklahoma.Reagan Love by the way pretty great name I think is a teacher. When if they had this tax cut what they told me was that that $2300 of money in their pocket they would go back to South Carolina and start a business.Imagine what it would be like instead of having more businesses closed than started we had it the exact opposite. We would grow our economy and the government would get the revenue necessary to make things make things better.Hillary Clinton's approach to this is more top-down more regulation more taxes more government and it will destroy our economy. It is I'd say it is Islamic terrorism and back to the question of what we are dealing with in Iraq when we pull back voids are filled. That's the lesson of history and sadly this president does not believe in American leadership. He does not believe it and the net result is that we have a caliphate the size of Indiana that gains energy each and everyday to recruit Americans in our own country and the threat to the homeland relates to the fact that we have not dealt with this threat of terror in the Middle East. We should have a no fly zone in Syria. We should have a support for the remnants of the Syrian Free Army and create safe zones. If you want to deal with the four million refugees that are leaving Syria because of the devastation there then we 'ought to create safe zones for them to stay in the region rather than go to Europe. And that requires American leadership.Without American leadership every other country in the neighborhood beings to change their priorities. It is tragic that you see Iraq and other countries now talking to Russia. It wasn't that long ago that Russia had no influence in the region at all. And so the United States needs to lead across the board.This president and Hillary Clinton both do not believe the United States has a leadership role to play and we're now paying a price and it will have a huge impact on the economy of this country if we don't deal with this. ...They're not doing that...  Donald Donald's wrong on this. He is absolutely wrong on this. We're not going to be the world's policeman but we sure as heck better be the world's leader. That's there's a huge difference where without us leading... ...voids are filled and the idea that it's a good idea for Putin to be in Syria let ISIS take out Assad and then Putin will take out ISIS? I mean that's like a board game that's like playing Monopoly or something. That's not how the real world works. We have to lead we have to be involved. We should have a no fly zone in Syria. There are they are barrel bombing the innocents in that country. If you're a Christian increasingly in Lebanon or Iraq or Syria you're going to be beheaded. And if you're a moderate Islamist you're not going to be able to survive either.We have to play a role in this be able to bring the rest of the world to this issue before it's too late. We're not we shouldn't have another financial crisis. What we ought to do is raise the capital requirements so banks aren't too big to fail. Dodd-Frank has actually done the opposite totally the opposite where banks now have higher concentration of risk in assets and the capital requirements aren't high enough. If we were serious about it we would raise the capital requirements and lessen the load on the community banks and other financial institutions. This vast overreach has created a huge problem for our country and Hillary Clinton wants to double down on that. I was in Washington Iowa about three months ago talking about how bad Washington D.C. is. It was get the kind of the anyway. We had... It and I talked to a banker there. This is a bank that had $125 million of assets four branches. Their compliance costs because of Dodd-Frank went from $100000 to $600000 in a two-year period. The net effect of that is and they had they had not one loan that went bad during the financial crisis. They knew they knew their borrowers. They gave back to the community. They were engaged in the community. And imagine America without its community banks. Well that's what's happening because of Dodd-Frank. That's that's my worry. My worry is that the real economy has been hurt by the vast overreach of the Obama administration.And Hillary Clinton she wants to double down on that. She wants to create even more so. She is a captive of the left of her party to the point now where she is she was for the trade agreement in the Pacific agreement. Now she's against it. She was hinted she was for the XL pipeline. Now she's opposed to it. All the things that would create sustained economic growth she's now doubling down against it. You could if you were serious about... No I can't say that. But I can say if you created higher capital requirements that's the solution to this not having concentration of assets. The bigger banks now have more and more control over over the financial assets of this country. And that is the wrong approach to take. Maria? ...We've had a 10% reduction in carbon emissions and it isn't because of Solyndra. It isn't because of the central planners in Washington D.C. It's because we've had a great American success story the explosion of natural gas. Taking two existing technologies and applying it through innovation has created lower carbon emissions lower energy costs 40% of all the economic activity in the age of Obama has come from the energy sector and Hillary Clinton wants to suppress that. We I think we ought to be expanding this. High growth is the path to lower carbon and more jobs.I know for a fact as Governor of the State of Florida we created the largest land purchasing programs and environment clean-up programs because we had a growing economy. Our revenues were growing at 4.4%. It allowed for resources to be able to protect the natural system.We got to get to a conservation... ...in environmental policy that goes beyond just carbon... Jane Horton is sitting with my wife here today. Her husband Chris was killed in action in Afghanistan. And Jane spends her time now defending and fighting for military families. They're both heroes. I don't think we need an agitator-in-chief or a divider-in-chief. We need a commander-in-chief that will rebuild our military and restore respect to our veterans by revamping and fixing a broken Veterans Administration That's my pledge to you. I ask for your support. Thank you."
2015-11-10 00:00:00,rubio, Well let me begin by answering both the first question and this one because they're related. As I've said many times before my parents were never rich people. My father was a bartender. My mother was a maid. They worked for a living. But they were successful people because despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood retire with dignity leave all four of their children better off than themselves. We call that the American dream but in fact it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. It is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. What makes America special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful.The problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. If I thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay I would be all for it but it isn't. In the 20th century it's a disaster.If you raise the minimum wage you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. And that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.Here's the best way to raise wages. Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business tax reform and regulatory reform bring our debt under control fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing repeal and replace Obamacare and make higher education faster and easier to access especially vocational training. For the life of me I don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers. If we do that and if we do this if we do this we will be able to increase wages for millions of Americans and we will be able to leave everyone better off without making anyone worse off. Well you know that's an excellent question because what we are going through in this country is not simply an economic downturn. We are living through a massive economic transformation. I mean this economy is nothing like what it was like five years ago not to mention 15 or 20 years ago. And it isn't just a different economy. It's changing faster than ever. You know it took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users. It took Candy Crush one year to reach some 100 million users. So the world is changing faster than ever and it is disruptive. Number one we are in a global competition now and several of the candidates have said that. There are now dozens of developed economies on this planet that we have to compete with. And we lose that competition because we have the highest business tax rate in the industrialized world because we have regulations that continue to grow by the billions every single week because we have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people but because we're not fully utilizing our energy resources that if we did it would bring back all kinds of growth especially in manufacturing and because we have an outdated higher education system.Our higher education system is completely outdated. It is too expensive too hard to access and it doesn't teach 21st century skills. If we do what needs to be done tax reform regulatory reform fully utilize our energy resources repeal and replace Obamacare and modernize higher education then we can grasp the potential and the promise of this new economy. And we won't just save the American dream. We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And then truly this new century can be a new American century. The most important job I'm ever going to have the most important job anyone in this room will ever have is the job of being a parent. Not the job of being president or the job of being a senator or the job of being a congressman. The most important job any of us will ever do is the job of being a president (sic) because the most important institution in society is the family. If the family breaks down society breaks down.You can't have a strong nation without strong values and no one is born with strong values. They have to be taught to you in strong families and reinforced in you in strong communities.And so when we set out to do tax reform we endeavor to have a pro-family tax code and we endeavor to do it because we know how difficult it is for families in the 21st century to afford the cost of living.It is expensive to raise children in the 21st century and families that are raising children are raising the future taxpayers of the United States and everything costs more. In 35 out of 50 states child care costs more than college.There are millions of people watching this broadcast tonight that understand exactly what I'm talking about. They don't know how they're going to make that payment every month and if they can't make it they can't work because someone needs to watch their kids during the day. They don't know how they're going to save for their kids' future to go to college.And so yes I have a child tax credit increase and I'm proud of it. I am proud that I have a pro-family tax code because the pro- family tax plan I have will strengthen the most important institution in the in the country the family. Now I get my 60 seconds to respond. He's talking about my tax plan. So let me begin with this. I actually believe first of all this is their money. They do pay. It is refundable not just against the taxes they pay to the government but also the on their federal income tax it's refundable against the payroll tax. Everyone pays payroll tax. This is their money. This is not our money. And here's what I don't understand if you invest that money in a piece of equipment if you invest that money in a business you get to write it off your taxes.But if you invest it in your children in the future of America and strengthening your family we're not going to recognize that in our tax code? The family is the most important institution in society. And yes... ... I do want to rebuild the American military. I know that Rand is a committed isolationist. I'm not. I believe the world is a stronger and a better place when the United States is the strongest military power in the world. Because... ...are you talking about the military Rand? We can't even have an economy if we're not safe. There are radical jihadist in the Middle East beheading people and crucifying Christians. A radical Shia cleric in Iran trying to get a nuclear weapon the Chinese taking over the South China Sea... ...Yes I believe the world is a safer no no I don't believe I know that the world is a safer place when America is the strongest military power in the world. You know if I may respond... I need to add a couple of points to this. The first is I've never met Vladimir Putin but I know enough about him to know he is a gangster. He is basically an organized crime figure that runs a country controls a $2 trillion economy. And is using to build up his military in a rapid way despite the fact his economy is a disaster. He understands only geopolitical strength. And every time he has acted anywhere in the world whether it's in Ukraine or Georgia before that or now in the Middle East it's because he is trusting in weakness.His calculation in the Middle East is that he has seen what this president has done which is nothing the president has no strategy our allies in the region do not trust us. For goodness sake there is only one pro-American free enterprise democracy in the Middle East it is the state of Israel. And we have a president that treats the prime minister of Israel with less respect than what he gives the ayatollah in Iran. And so our allies in the region don't trust us. Vladimir Putin is exploiting that weakness for purposes of edging the Americans out as the most important geopolitical power broker in the region. And we do have a vested interest. And here's why.Because all those radical terrorist groups that by the way are not just in Syria and in Iraq ISIS is now in Libya. They are a significant presence in Libya and in Afghanistan and a growing presence in Pakistan.Soon they will be in Turkey. They will try Jordan. They will try Saudi Arabia. They are coming to us. They recruit Americans using social media. And they don't hate us simply because we support Israel. They hate us because of our values. They hate us because our girls go to school. They hate us because women drive in the United States. Either they win or we win and we had better take this risk seriously it is not going away on its own. Can I just add what he's right on point there. Do you know why these banks are so big? The government made them big. The government made them big by adding thousands and thousands of pages of regulations. So the big banks they have an army of lawyers they have an army of compliance officers. They can deal with all these things. The small banks like Governor Bush was saying they can't deal with all these regulations. They can't deal with all they cannot hire the fanciest law firm in Washington or the best lobbying firm to deal with all these regulations. And so the result is the big banks get bigger the small banks struggle to lend or even exist and the result is what you have today. And in Dodd-Frank you have actually codified too big to fail. We have actually created a category of systemically important institutions and these banks go around bragging about it. You know what they say to people with a wink and a nod? We are so big we are so important that if we get in trouble the government has to bail us out. This is an outrage. We need to repeal Dodd-Frank as soon as possible. Well that's a great question and let me begin by answering it. This election is about the future about what kind of country this nation is gonna be in the 21st century. This next (ph) election is actually a generational choice. A choice about what kind of nation we will be in the 21st century.For over 2.5 centuries America's been a special country the one place on earth where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything a nation that's been a force for good on this planet.But now a growing number of Americans feel out of place in their own country. We have a society that stigmatizes those that hold cultural values that are traditional.We have a society where people millions of people are living paycheck to paycheck. They're working as hard as they ever have but they're living paycheck to paycheck because the economy has changed underneath their feet.We have young Americans who owe thousands of dollars in student loans for a degree that doesn't lead to a job. For the first time in 35 years we have more businesses dying than starting and around the world every day brings news of a new humiliation for America many the direct response direct consequence of decisions made when Hillary Clinton was the secretary of the of state. And so here's the truth: this election is about the future and the Democratic Party and the political left has no ideas about the future. All their ideas are the same tired ideas of the past. More government more spending. For every issue for America their answer is a new tax on someone and a new government program. This nation is going to turn the page and that's what this election should be about and as I said at the first debate... ...If I am our nominee they will be the party of the past we will be the party of the 21st century. Ours the story of America is an extraordinary story. It is the story of a nation that for over two centuries each generation has left the next better off than themselves. But now because Washington is out of touch for the fault of both political parties for the first time in our history that is in doubt. And that is what this election must be about because if the next four years are anything like the last eight years our children will be the first Americans ever left worse off by their parents. This election is about making a different choice about applying our principles of limited government and free enterprise to the unique issues of our time. And if we do we will not just save the American dream. We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And the 21st century can be a new American century.So tonight I ask you for your vote and I ask you to join us at my website marcorubio.com.
2015-11-10 00:00:00,carson, Well first of all delighted to be here. My family's here and my little granddaughter who's three years old said she wanted to come to the debate. So this is very cool. As far as the minimum wage is concerned people need to be educated on the minimum wage. Every time we raise the minimum wage the number of jobless people increases.It's particularly a problem in the black community. Only 19.8 percent of black teenagers have a job who are looking for one. You know that and that's because of those high wages. If you lower those wages that comes down.You know I can remember as a youngster you know my first job working in a laboratory as a lab assistant and multiple other jobs. But I would not have gotten those jobs if someone had to pay me a large amount of money.But what I did gain from those jobs is a tremendous amount of experience and how to operate in the world and how to relate to different people and how to become a responsible individual. And that's what gave me what I needed to ascend the ladder of opportunity in this country.That's what we need to be thinking about. How do we allow people to ascend the ladder of opportunity rather than how do we give them everything and keep them dependent? I would not raise it. I would not raise it specifically because I'm interested in making sure that people are able to enter the job market and take advantage of opportunities. Well first of all thank you not asking me what I said in the 10th grade. I appreciate that. The fact of the matter is you know what we should vet all candidates. I have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth. And I don't even mind that so much if they do it about with everybody like people on the other side. But you know when I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no this was a terrorist attack and then tells everybody else that it was a video.Where I came from they call that a lie. And... I think that's very different from you know somebody misinterpreting when I said that I was offered a scholarship to West Point that is the words that they used. But I've had many people come and say the same thing to me.That is what people do in those situations. We have to start treating people the same and finding out what people really think and what they're made of. People who know me know that I'm an honest person. Well you know when I say tithing I'm talking about the concept of proportionality. Everybody should pay the same proportion of what they make. You make $10 billion you pay a billion. You make $10 you pay one. You get same rights and privileges. I don't see how anything gets a whole lot fairer than that. But you also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes because that is the thing that tilts it in one direction or another. And you have to set the rate at an appropriate level.Now I will say that there are a lot of people who say if you get rid of the deductions you ruin the American dream because you know home mortgage deduction. But the fact of the matter is people had homes before 1913 when we introduced the federal income tax and later after that started deductions. And they say there will be no more charitable giving. We had churches before that and charitable organizations before that. The fact of the matter is I believe if you put more money in people's pockets that they will actually be more generous rather than less generous. And it's... ... the money that they earned. And the other thing is I do care about the poor people. And in the system that we're putting together there will be a rebate for people at the poverty level. But I also want to emphasize the fact that as we get the economy moving and I hope I get a question about how do we get the economy moving there will be a lot more opportunities for poor people not to be poor people because this is America.This is the land of dreams. And our policies should be aimed at allowing people to realize that dream. Well putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there because they that's why they're called special ops they're actually able to guide some of the other things that we're doing there. And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way.We also must recognize that it's a very complex place. You know the Chinese are there as well as the Russians and you have all kinds of factions there.What we've been doing so far is very ineffective but we can't give up ground right there. But we have to look at this on a much more global scale. We're talking about global jihadists. And their desire is to destroy us and to destroy our way of life. So we have to be saying how do we make them look like losers? Because that's the way that they're able to gather a lot of influence.And I think in order to make them look like losers we have to destroy their caliphate. And you look for the easiest place to do that? It would be in Iraq. And if outside of Anbar in Iraq there's a big energy field. Take that from them. Take all of that land from them. We could do that I believe fairly easily I've learned from talking to several generals and then you move on from there.But you have to continue to face them because our goal is not to contain them but to destroy them before they destroy us. Well I think we should have policies that don't allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities. And certainly some of the policies some of the monetary and Fed policies that we're using makes it very easy for them makes it very easy for the big corporations quite frankly at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially. Those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place. And I think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. This country was declared its independence in 1776. In less than 100 years it was the number-one economic power in the world. And the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. Those are the fuels that drive it.And what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations which is involved in every aspect of our lives. If we can get that out it makes a big difference. And even for the average person every single regulation costs money. And it's shifted to the individual.So and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. They go into the store and they buy a bar of soap it costs 10 cents more they notice it. And the middle class when they come to the cash register have a whole cart full of things that cost 5 10 or 15 cents more they notice it. It is hurting the poor.Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton won't tell you that that's the thing that's really hurting middle class in the core. They'll say it's the rich take their money but that won't help. You can take all of the rich's money and it won't make a dent in the problem that we're having. We have to come back to the fundamental principles that made America great. I would have policies that wouldn't allow that to occur. I don't want to go in and tear anybody down. I mean that doesn't help us. But what does help us is stop tinkering around the edges and fix the actual problems that exist that are creating the problem in the first place. In the two hours of this of this debate five people have died from drug-related deaths $100 million has been added to our national debt 200 babies have been killed by abortionists and two veterans have taken their lives out of despair. This is a narrative that we can change not we the Democrats not we the Republicans but we the people of America because there is something special about this nation and we must embrace it and be proud of it and never give it away for the sake of political correctness.
2015-11-10 00:00:00,fiorina," Well first of all I must say as I think about that question I think about a woman I met the other day. I would guess she was 40 years old. She had several children. And she said to me you know Carly I go to bed every night afraid for my children's future. And that really struck me. This is America. A mother is going to bed afraid for her children's future. And the reason she's afraid for her children's future is because we've had problems for a long time. Yes problems have gotten much worse under Democrats. But the truth is this government has been growing bigger and bigger more corrupt less effective crushing the engine of economic growth for a very long time. This isn't about just replacing a Democrat with a Republican now. It's about actually challenging the status quo of big government.Big government has created a big business called politics. And there are lots of people invested in the status quo of that big business called politics. Specifically we need actually to do five things to really get this economy going again. We need to go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dollar is being spent we can challenge any dollar cut any dollar move any dollar. We need to actually reform the tax code. Go to a three-page tax code. Yes there are plans that would reform our tax code to three pages. In addition to rolling back what President Obama has done we need to do a top-to-bottom review of every single regulation on the books. That hasn't been done in 50 years. We need to pass the REINS Act so Congress is in charge of regulation not nameless faceless bureaucrats accountable to no one. We've become a nation of rules not a nation of laws.And finally we actually yes have to hold government officials accountable for their performance. All this has to be done and the citizens of this nation must help a President Fiorina get it done. We must take our government back. Well first Obamacare has to be repealed because it's failing... ...it's failing the very people it was intended to help but also it is croney-capitalism at its worst. Who helped write this bill? Drug companies insurance companies pharmaceutical companies every single one of those kinds of companies are bulking up to deal with big government. See that's what happens. As government gets bigger and bigger and it has been for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike and business have to bulk up to deal with big government.So we have to repeal it. It's tens of thousands of pages long no one can possible understand it except the big companies the lawyers the accountants the lobbyists that they hire to protect their interests. Then we have to give back to states the responsibility to manage a high risk pool. We need to try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried. Health insurance has always been a cozy little game between regulators and health insurance companies.We need to try the free market. The free market. Where people actually have to compete. And we 'ought to have the government ensure that you must and I don't use that term often that government 'ought to do something but every healthcare provider 'ought to publish its costs its prices its outcomes because as patients we don't know what we're buying. Now let me just say let me just say I know more about innovation and entrepreneurship than anyone on this panel because I have led innovative businesses in the most highly competitive industry in the world for decades. The truth is the secret sauce of America is innovation and entrepreneurship it is why we must cut our government down to size and hold it accountable. It's why we have to take our government back because innovation and entrepreneurship is crushed by the crushing load of a 73000 page tax code. It is crushed... ...by regulatory thicket that is so vast we don't even know what's in it anymore. It is crushed as well by government bureaucrats who don't do their jobs very well and who are not held accountable which is why I've said we got to take our government back and to do that we have to know where every dollar being spent and be able to move any dollar. We have to hack through this regulatory thicket repeal so much but also know what's in that regulatory thicket we don't even know what regulations have been passed.Third we need to build a meritocracy Scott Walker by the way is trying now to do in Wisconsin... ...Finally we need to get to a three page tax code and yes that plan exists. Sorry I can't hear you. ...Absolutely... ...You need to give... The alternative is to allow states to manage high risk pools for those who really need help. Look I'm a cancer survivor OK? I understand that you cannot have someone who's battled cancer just become known as a pre-existing condition. I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help. But I also understand that Obamacare isn't helping anyone. We're throwing more and more people into Medicaid and fewer and fewer doctors are taking those payments. The point is Obamacare is crushing small businesses it is not helping the families it was intended to help. So let us allow states to manage high risk pools. Let us try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried the free market. Let us ensure that as patients and customers... ...that we have information to shop wisely for our health care. ...Yes the middle ground is this... ...This is why this is why we must combine actually zero-based budgeting with tax reform because unless we can examine and cut and move every single dollar of discretionary spending in the federal government we cannot reform taxes and reduce spending at the same time. Ask yourself this question how is it possible that the federal government gets more money each and every year which the federal government has been doing receiving more money every year for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike and yet never has enough money to do the important things?The answer? All the money's always spoken for. All the money's spoken for. So we have to go to zero-based budgeting which is a simple idea by the way there's been a bill for zeros-based (ph) budgeting... ...It exists it can be voted on. Every dollar must be examined. Any dollar can be cut. Any dollar can be cut any dollar can be moved. We have to go to a three page tax code. You lower every rate you close every loophole why? Because the government uses the tax code to decide winners and losers. You have to strip the corruption out of the tax code to pay for it. You have to know where every single dollar is being spent... ...Cut where you need to and invest where you need to... ...The two go hand in hand... You know Mr. Trump fancies himself a very good negotiator. And I accept that he's done a lot of good deals so Mr. Trump 'ought to know that we should not speak to people from a position of weakness. Senator Paul should know that as well. One of the reasons I've said that I would not be talking to Vladimir Putin right now although I have met him as well not in a green room for a show but in a private meeting. One of the reasons I've said I wouldn't be talking to Vladimir Putin right now is because we are speaking to him from a position of weakness brought on by this administration so I wouldn't talk to him for awhile but I would do this. I would start rebuilding the Sixth Fleet right under his nose rebuilding the military the missile defense program in Poland right under his nose. I would conduct very aggressive military exercises in the Baltic States so that he understood we would protect our NATO allies... ...and I might also put in a few more thousand troops into Germany not to start a war but to make sure that Putin understand that the United States of America will stand with our allies. That is why Governor Bush is correct. We must have a no fly zone in Syria because Russia cannot tell the United States of America where and when to fly our planes. We also have a set of allies... ...We also have a set of allies in the Arab Middle East that know that ISIS is their fight. They have asked us specifically over and over again to support them. King Abdullah of Jordan a man I've known for a very long time has asked us for bombs and material we have not provided it. The Egyptians are asking us to share intelligence we are not I will. The Kurds have asked us to arm them for three years we are not I would. The Egyptians the Saudis the Kuwaitis the Bahrain's the Emirati the Kurds... ...all of these I know by the way understand ISIS is their fight but they must see leadership support and resolve from the United States of America... ...we have the strongest military on the face of the planet and everyone has to know it. ...Ronald Reagan walked away at Reykjavik. ...he walked away he quit talks... ...when it was time to quit talking... Can I just could I just say as a chief executive who's had to make tough calls to save jobs and to grow jobs I think what's interesting about Dodd-Frank is it's a great example of how socialism starts. Socialism starts when government creates a problem and then government steps in to solve the problem. Government created the problem. Government created the problem of a real estate boom. How did we create it? Under Republican and Democrats alike Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac everybody gathered together Republicans and Democrats and said ""home ownership is part of the American dream. Let's create a bubble"" and then government stepped in by the way under president George W. Bush banks were told encouraged told really to buy other banks to take money.And now what do we have with Dodd-Frank? The classic of crony capitalism. The big have gotten bigger 1590 community banks have gone out of business and on top of all that we've created something called the Consumer Financial Production Bureau a vast bureaucracy with no congressional oversight that's digging through hundreds of millions of your credit records to detect fraud.This is how socialism starts ladies and gentlemen. We must take our government back. Imagine a Clinton presidency. Our military will continue to deteriorate. Our veterans will not be cared for. And no Mrs. Clinton that situation is not exaggerated. The rich will get richer. The poor will get poorer. The middle class will continue to get crushed. And as bad as that picture is what's even worse is that a Clinton presidency will corrode the character of this nation. Why? Because of the Clinton way: Say whatever you have to lie as long as you can get away with it.We must beat Hillary Clinton. Carly Fiorina can beat Hillary Clinton. I will beat Hillary Clinton. And under a President Fiorina we will restore the character of this nation the security of this nation the prosperity of this nation because as citizens we will take our government back."
2015-11-10 00:00:00,cavuto, It is 9:00 p.m. on the East Coast 8:00 p.m. here inside the Milwaukee theater. Welcome to the Republican presidential debate here on the Fox Business Network. I'm Neil Cavuto alongside my co-moderators Maria Bartiromo and the editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal Gerard Baker. Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. It sounds like a game show but it's not. Now I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the elephant in the room and I'm not talking about your party's fine symbol. I'm talking about the purpose of tonight's debate.The economy and what each of you would do to improve it. No more no less. We are focused on those issues and what you have said on those issues in your words and what your opponents have said in their words about your words. That is the agenda tonight. How each of you plans to make America better tomorrow. And so we begin. Candidates as we gather tonight in this very august theater just outside and across the country picketers are gathering as well. They're demanding an immediate hike in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Just a few hours ago near Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed doing the same for all state workers the first governor to do so.Mr. Trump as the leading presidential candidate on this stage and one whose tax plan exempts couples making up to $50000 a year from paying any federal income taxes at all are you sympathetic to the protesters cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31000 a year? So do not raise the minimum wage? Dr. Carson you have long bemoaned this lackluster recovery. And this Facebook map show Americans share your concern. The green represents how the jobs issue is resonating all across the nation especially here in the state of Wisconsin. You suggested one minimum wage does not fit all and that perhaps we should offer a lower or starter wage for young people. Those protesters outside are looking for $15 and nothing less. Where are you? So sir just to be clear you would not raise it? Senator Rubio you called the recent Democratic debate in Las Vegas a night of giveaways including free health care free college and a host of other government-paid benefits. Since you aren't a fan of all they're giving away tell us tonight what you would take back. Thank you Senator Rubio. All right. We're only just getting started. Coming up your taxes. Stick around. You're watching FOX Business Welcome back to the Milwaukee Theater and the Republican presidential debate. Let's get right back to our questions. Dr. Carson to you. You recently railed against the double- standard in the media sir that seems obsessed with inconsistencies and potential exaggerations in your life story but looked the other way when it came to then-Senator Barack Obama's. Still as a candidate whose brand has always been trust are you worried your campaign which you've always said sir is bigger than you is now being hurt by you? I'll just forget that follow-up there. Thank you Dr. Carson. Alright thank you. We're going to take a break here. Coming up a big issue many Americans are facing taxes. The Republican Presidential Debate continues now live from Milwaukee. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from Milwaukee. Let's get back to the questions. And we want to touch on obviously one of the biggest of this issue in this year taxes. And this will go to several of you. One of the biggest economic concerns of course in the country are taxes. Facebook data certainly backs that up. Once again the green on this map that we're going to see here shows how the conversation around taxes is resonating across the nation especially here in Wisconsin.First off Dr. Carson to you. You say you are in favor of a tax system I guess akin to tithing sir with a flat tax rate of up to 15 percent because you said if everybody pays this I think God is a pretty fair guy so tithing is a pretty fair process.But Donald Trump says that is not fair. That wealthier taxpayers should pay a higher rate because it's a fair thing to do. So whose plan would God endorse then Doctor? Yours or Mr. Trump's? Right. Thank you very much. Senator Paul you said you want to blow up the tax code and start over with an across-the-board 14.5 percent fair and flat tax. You happily offered that it is not revenue neutral and that's the idea. You want to choke off the amount of money coming into Washington.But don't you risk sir creating a near-term budget crisis just as your presidency would be beginning? There are no deductions on your under your plan? Thank you Senator. Senator Paul... Senator Paul you have already said sir that that would be a mistake in not talking to Vladimir Putin or to rule it out. You've argued that it's never a good idea to close down communication. With that in mind do you think the same applies to administration efforts right now to include the Iranians in talks on Syria? ...Well then how would you respond? But if you're not going to respond in a no-fly zone strategy what would yours be? All right. And look at the time look at the time. You are watching FOX Business we'll take a break. Stick around. Senator Cruz and I will get to you but Senator Cruz on that theme Facebook data shows that over the last month alone nearly 1 million people nearly 1 million have been concerned about reining in Wall Street apparently believing that some have not been punished enough. So as an accomplished litigator yourself and a former solicitor general would you go after the very people who believe and fear that Wall Street has ignored in other words the crooks that Bernie Sanders say have gotten away with a financial murder? Senator... ...Senator I really want to be clear here. Are you saying sir that if Bank of America were on the brink you would let it fail? Sir I understand that. I just want to be clear if you don't mind that millions of depositors would be on the line with that decision. And I just want to be clear. If it were to happen again for whatever the reason you would let it go you would let a Bank of America go? OK I think it's fair to say you're not fans of Hillary Clinton's resume. Alright Mr. Trump.... I had a feeling. Perhaps the most successful capitalist on this stage tonight you've acknowledged that some give capitalism a bad name. You've been particularly critical of businesses that find all sorts of ways of paying their taxes by keeping money abroad but your own plan includes an incentive to bring that more the $2 trillion dollars home. Isn't that like a one-time bounty... ...Some of the guys you all but call pirates so they still keep the loot and pay only a price to bring it back. ...Alright gentlemen I know you want to and I want to be we also promised to get people home tonight and we are going to take a quick break here. I think it is fair to say at this juncture that you can discuss these issues and only business issues but still keep it interesting. Stick around for these candidates closing statements. Senator Marco Rubio? Dr. Ben Carson? Donald Trump? Candidates we want to thank you all. We also appreciate your helping save time by talking over one another at times. That was welcomed. But by all means it was a very riveting debate. Business issues can be can be riveting because it wasn't about us it's about them.
2015-11-10 00:00:00,kasich, First of all let me just say that in the state of Ohio and I'm the only acting executive on on this stage today we do have a moderate increase in the minimum wage. And I got to tell you my father carried mail on his back. His father was a coal miner. He died of black lung. He was losing his eyesight. My mother's mother lived with us. She could barely speak English. I come from a town where if the wind blew the wrong way people found themselves out of work. An economic theory is fine but you know what? People need help. Now I have a plan that in fact would cut taxes but not $11 trillion or $12 trillion that would put my children further in debt. I have a plan that would not only cut taxes lower the income tax rate for individuals lower the tax for businesses so businesses will compete here and not move operations overseas and also a plan the only plan of anybody standing on this stage to get us to a balanced budget by the end of a second term.And you know the simple fact of the matter is we hear a lot of promises in this debate a lot of promises about these tax cuts or tax schemes sometimes that I call them. Hillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side. We've got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side.Yes lower taxes lower spending. My website JohnKasich.com will show you exactly how we balance the budget. I balanced the budget in Washington as a chief architect and I have balanced it in Ohio for one reason. When you balance the budget and you cut taxes people get work.And our most important moral purpose as leaders in the political system is to make sure we create an environment for job creation so people can live their dreams and realize their God-given potential. That's why it's so important.And for those at the bottom we've got to do what we can to train them so they can move up. But to just look the other way is not acceptable because you know what as the governor of Ohio I have to deal with real challenges and we've gotten it done in our state and I will do it for America. Sure. We would move the Medicare system from a 7 percent growth down to about a 5 percent growth. And I have a whole series of ways to do that. In Ohio we reduced Medicaid funding for the poor from 10 percent to 2.5 percent didn't cut one benefit or didn't take anybody off the rolls. Why? Because we're innovators. I've been an innovator my entire career. And I really don't care what special interests or lobbyists have to say. I have a job to do when I take over a public office. Now we freeze non-defense discretionary for eight years. We also put an increase in defense spending. Our tax cuts balance out. And at the end of the day we will get to a balanced budget. And I want everybody here to know when I was Budget Committee chairman in Washington I stepped on every toe in that town and we got to a balanced budget and we had enormous job growth. And as governor of Ohio we went from 350000 lost jobs to a gain of 347000 jobs. I'll do it in Washington. I've done it twice; I'll do it thrice for the United States of America. Excuse me. Yeah I would like to make a comment. I appreciate it Jeb. I'm all of you. But I want at some point to talk about a value-added tax and $11 trillion $12 trillion tax cuts that will put our kids way deeper in the hole than they have been at this point. So I would like to talk about it at some point because that's what leadership is. Maria can we comment on that? Can we comment on that? Well look in 1986 Ronald Reagan basically said the people who were here if they were law-abiding could stay. But what didn't happen is we didn't build the walls effectively and we didn't control the border. We need to. We need to control our border just like people have to control who goes in and out of their house. But if people think that we are going to ship 11 million people who are law-abiding who are in this country and somehow pick them up at their house and ship them out of Mexico to Mexico think about the families. Think about the children.So you know what the answer really is? If they have been law- abiding they pay a penalty. They get to stay. We protect the wall. Anybody else comes over they go back.But for the 11 million people come on folks. We all know you can't pick them up and ship them across back across the border. It's a silly argument. It is not an adult argument. It makes no sense. Jerry Gerald it was an attack. In the state of Ohio the state of Ohio we have grown 347000 jobs. Our unemployment is half of what it was. Our fracking industry energy industry may have contributed 20000 but if Mr. Trump understood that the real jobs come in the downstream not in the upstream but in the downstream. And that's where we're going to get our jobs. But Ohio is diversified. And little false little things sir they don't really work when it comes to the truth. So the fact is all I'm suggesting we can't ship 11 million people out of this country. Children would be terrified and it will not work. ...Mr. Baker everybody got to talk about taxes... ...I think you were coming to me and then... ...Look I hate to crash the party to you Mr. Baker but you know what's fair... ...Yes sir... Let me tell you this Mr. Baker in terms of the cyber attacks we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us. I want to give you a little trip around the world. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. In the Ukraine arm the people there so they can fight for themselves. In the eastern part of Europe make sure that Finland and the Baltics know that if the Russians move we move.In Syria yes a no-fly zone in the north on the Turkish border a no-fly zone on the south on the Jordanian border. Anybody flies in the first time maybe they can fly out. They fly in there a second time they will not fly out.And it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. And it also sends many messages in the Middle East that we're still involved.Saudi Arabia cut off the funding for the radical clerics the ones that preach against us. But they're fundamentally our friends. Jordan we want the king to reign for 1000 years. Egypt they have been our ally and a moderating force in the Middle East throughout their history.In the groups in the countries of the Gulf states of Bahrain the Cleveland Clinic is opening an operation. Clearly we see the same with them. And in Israel we have no better ally in the world and no more criticizing them in public we should support them.And finally China China doesn't own the South China Sea and I give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the Chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more.And in the trade agreement the TPP it's critical to us not only for economic reasons and for jobs because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade but it allows us to create not only economy alliances but also potentially strategic alliances against the Chinese. They are not our enemy but they are certainly not our friend.And finally I will say to everyone in this room we have been talking about taxes and economics. When the fall comes and we run against Hillary which will be a disaster if she got elected. I have two 16-year-old girls and I want this country to be strong.We make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall we will have trouble. We must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. I served in Washington as the chairman of the Budget Committee and we got the budget balanced.And in Ohio as the CEO and guess what we have got to have a CEO mentality and a way to beat Hillary Clinton and the Democracies in the fall. And our ideas have to add up. They have to be solid. And people have to know we have the confidence to lead America.And as president I will lead this country as I have before in Washington and in Ohio and will return both on domestic and international affairs. And I appreciate the opportunity to speak this time Gerry. Let me let me also say Gary Gary let me also say Jeb is what Jeb is talking about with the big banks is to force them to reserve their capital people who invest it and they hold their capital so that if the bank goes down the people who are invested in the bank are the ones that pay. That's what he's trying to say. Secondly I'll tell you about Wall Street: There's too much greed. And the fact is a free enterprise system is a system that's produced the greatest wealth for the world. But you know Michael Novak the great Catholic theologian says that a free enterprise system that is not underlaid with values and we should all think about the way we conduct our lives yes free enterprise is great profits are great but there have to be some values that underlay it and they need a good ethics lesson on Wall Street on a regular basis to keep them in check so we the people do not lose. Neil that's the difference of being an executive. And let me just explain: when a bank is ready to go under and depositors are getting ready to lose their life savings you just don't say we believe in philosophical concerns. You know what an executive has to decide? When there's a water crisis how do we get water to the city? When there's a school shooting how do you get there and help heal a community? When there are financial crisis or a crisis with ebola you got to go there and try to fix it. Philosophy doesn't work when you run something. And I gotta tell you on-the-job training for president of the United States doesn't work. We've done it for 8 years and almost 8 years now. It does not work. We need an executive who's been tried has been tested and judge the decisions that that executive makes. I don't like what the Fed is doing but I'll tell you what worries me more than anything else: turning the Fed over to the Congress of the United States... ...so they can print the money. That would be a very bad approach. I wouldn't. I wouldn't. No. No I didn't say that. They were they were talking about what you would do with depositors. Would you let these banks shut down? My argument is going forward the banks have to reserve the capital so that the so that the people who own the capital start pressuring the banks to not take these risky approaches Ted.But at the end of the day... ... I'm gonna tell you this. Let me tell you this. If during if during... ...because if during well I'll tell you what (ph). CRUZ: What would you do if the bank was failing? I would not let the people who put their money in there all go down. As an executive no. As an executive I would figure out how to separate those people who can afford it versus those people or the hard-working folks who put those money in those institutions... ... let me no no. Let me say another thing. Here's what I mean by that. Here's what I mean by that. When you are faced when you are faced in the last financial crisis with banks going under with banks going under and people people who put their their life savings in there you got to deal with it. You can't turn a blind eye to it. Now going forward that's one thing. If you had another financial crisis perhaps there would be an effort to make sure that we do (ph). Well ladies and gentlemen if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders were to win this election my 16-year-olds I I worry about what their life is going to be like. You know the conservative movement is all about opportunity. It is about lower taxes. It's about balanced budgets. It's about less regulation. And it's about sending power money and influence back to where we live so we can run America from the bottom up.In addition to that once we have the power and the money and the influence with programs we shift out that each of us have a responsibility to reach out and to rebuild our families make them stronger and connect our neighborhoods. All that together wealth connection family America's greatest days are ahead. We must win this election.
2015-11-10 00:00:00,cruz," Well Maria it's great to be with you. It's great to be here in Milwaukee. You know the question you asked really I think is the most important question any of us can have face which is how do we get the economy growing? How do we bring back economic growth? Because economic growth it's foundational to every other challenge we have. As you rightly noted from 2008 to today our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average. The Obama economy is a disaster and the IMF is telling us this is a new normal. It doesn't have to be.If you look at the history of America there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. The first is tax reform. And as you noted I have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every American that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade.The second element is regulatory reform pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses.And the third element is sound money. Every time we've pursued all three of those whether in the 1920s with Calvin Coolidge or the 1960s with JFK or the 1980s with Ronald Reagan the result has been incredible economic growth. We have done it before and with leadership we can do it again. Well my Mom is here so I don't think we should be pushing any grannies off cliffs. And you miss-stated what I've said on entitlement reform. What I've said is for seniors we should make no changes whatsoever for younger workers we should gradually raise the retirement age we should have benefits grow more slowly and we should allow them to keep a portion of their taxes in a personal account that they control and can pass on to their kids... I want to go back to the discussion we had a minute ago because you know what was said was right. The democrats are laughing because if republicans join democrats as the party of amnesty we will lose. And you know I understand that when the mainstream media covers immigration it doesn't often see it as an economic issue. But I can tell you for millions of Americans at home watching this it is a very personal economic issue. And I will say the politics of it will be very very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande. Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press. Then we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation. And I will say for those of us who believe people 'ought to come to this country legally and we should enforce the law we're tired of being told it's anti-immigrant. It's offensive. I am the son of an immigrant who came legally from Cuba... ...to seek the American dream. And we can embrace legal immigration while believing in the rule of law and I would note try going illegally to another country. Try going to China or Japan. Try going to Mexico. See what they do. Every sovereign nation secures its borders and it is not compassionate to say we're not going to enforce the laws... ...And we're going to drive down the wages for millions of hardworking men and women. That is abandoning the working... Well sure you put your finger on what the problem is. The current system isn't fair. Washington is fundamentally corrupt. There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible and and not a one of them is as good. Every one of them reflects a carve-out or a subsidy and it's all about empowering the Washington cartel. My simple Flat Tax says that for a family of four for the first $36000 you earn you pay no taxes whatsoever. No income taxes no payroll taxes no nothing.Above that every American pays 10 percent across the board a flat fair tax. Which means that no longer do you have hedge-fund billionaires paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries.On the business side I've got a business flat tax of 16 percent again that applies across the board. Right now with our corporate income tax giant corporations with armies of accountants regularly are paying little to no taxes while small businesses are getting hammered.This is fair and across-the-board. Now you ask how do the numbers add up? I would encourage folks if you go to our website tedcruz.org we have the specific numbers on the website.This plan eliminates the payroll tax eliminates the death tax eliminates the corporate income tax and it abolishes the IRS. And the effect of that is incredible economic growth. It means every income group will see double-digit increases from the very poorest to the very weakest of at least 14 percent.So if you're a single mom if you're making $40000 a year what that means is an extra about $5000 in your pocket to provide for your kids to make ends meet. It has a powerful powerful effect.And there's one other really powerful feature of my plan which is that it's border-adjustable. Which means if you're an exporter if you're a farmer if you're a rancher if you're a manufacturer you don't pay the businesses flat tax.Exports are free of that tax but all imports pay that 16 percent business flat tax which means this tax plan would cause jobs to boom and it would let America compete with China and the world on a level playing field. Well the numbers the Tax Foundation had put out is that the static cost of the plan is $3.6 trillion over 10 years but the dynamic cost of the plan which which is the cost that factors in growth is about $768 billion. It is less than a trillion. It costs less than virtually every other plan people have put up here and yet it produces more growth and it's one of the very few plans that abolishes the IRS.But on top of that today we rolled out a spending plan. $500 billion in specific cuts five major agencies that I would eliminate. The IRS the Department of Commerce the Department of Energy the Department of Commerce and HUD and then 25 specific programs.Again that's on our website at tedcruz.org. You want to look at specificity? It's easy for everyone to say ""cut spending"". It's much harder and riskier to put out chapter and verse specifically the programs you would cut to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids. ...Middle ground that brings both of these together... ...Exactly right that we have to defend this nation. You think defending this nation is expensive try not defending it. That's a lot more expensive. But you can do that and pay for it. You can do that and also be fiscally responsible. You know I mention that the 25 programs that I put today that I would eliminate them. Among them are corporate welfare like sugar subsidies. Let's take that as an example. Sugar subsidies. Sugar farmers farm under... ...under roughly 0.2% of the farmland in America and yet they give 40% of the lobbying money. That sort of corporate welfare is why we're bankrupting our kids and grandkids. I would end those subsidies to pay for defending this nation... Absolutely yes. You know I have spent much of my adult life enforcing the law and defending the Constitution. And the problem that underlies all of this is the cronyism and corruption of Washington. You know the opening question Jerry asked would you bail out the big banks again? Nobody gave you an answer to that. I'll give you an answer. Absolutely not. And what we have right now is we have Washington as government gets bigger and bigger you know the biggest lie in all of Washington and in all of politics is that Republicans are the party of the rich. The truth is the rich do great with big government. They get in bed with big government. The big banks get bigger and bigger and bigger under Dodd-Frank and community banks are going out of business. And by the way the consequence of that is small businesses can't get business loans and it is that fundamental corruption that is why six of the 10 wealthiest counties in America are in and around Washington D.C.And let me give you a contrast to Washington cronyism. Some weeks ago a woman named Sabina Loving testified at a hearing that I chaired in the Senate. Sabina Loving is an African-American single mom who started a tax preparation business in the south side of Chicago. She found a store front she wanted to have her own business. She started a business.But then the IRS promulgated new regulations targeting tax preparers. They did it under a more than 100-year-old statute called the Dead Horse Act. Now this statute and the IRS in classic Washington crony fashion had exemptions for lawyers and big fancy accountants but Sabina had to pay $1000 an employee. It would have driven her out of business and Ms. Loving sued the IRS. She took the Obama IRS to court and she won and they struck down the rule for picking the big guys over the little guys. Yes. Now let's be clear there is a role for the Federal Reserve what the Fed is doing now is it is a series of philosopher- kings trying to guess what's happening with the economy. You look at the Fed one of the reasons we had the financial crash is throughout the 2000s we had loose money we had an asset bubble it drove up the price of real estate drove up the price of commodities and then in the third quarter of 2008 the Fed tightened the money and crashed those asset prices which caused a cascading collapse. That's why I am supporting getting back to rules-based monetary system not with a bunch of philosopher-kings deciding but tied... So let me be clear. I would not bail them out but instead of adjusting monetary policy according to whims and getting it wrong over and over again and causing booms and busts what the Fed should be doing is number one keeping our money tied to a stable level of gold and number two serving as a lender of last resort. That's what central banks do. So if you have a run on the bank the Fed can serve as a lender of last resort but it's not a bailout. It is a loan at higher interest rates. That's how central banks have worked.And I'll point out look we had a gold standard under Bretton Woods we had it for about 170 years of our nation's history and enjoyed booming economic growth and lower inflation than we have had with the Fed now.We need to get back to sound money which helps in particular working men and women. What Washington does the people who are doing well in the Obama economy are those with power and influence in the Obama government. The people who working men and women... So Governor Kasich... ...why would you then bail out rich Wall Street banks but not Main street not Mom and Pop not Sabina Loving? But you just said an executive... ...knows to step in and bail out a bank. So you said you'd abandon philosophy and abandon principle... ...but what would you do if the bank was failing? So you you would bail them out. And Maria I will note she's got a lot of experience but her policies have proven disastrous. If you look at foreign policy every region in the world has gotten worse. Under her leadership we abandon the nation of Israel. Under her leadership radical Islamic terrorism has been on to the rise. Under her leadership and Obama's leadership Iran is getting $100 billion dollars and on the verge of getting a nuclear weapon. Everything she's put her hand to or has touched and when we talk about the cronyism of Washington Hillary Clinton embodies the cronyism... ...of Washington. And I'll give you an example of that which is the Congressional exemption from Obamacare which is fundamentally wrong and I'll tell you this if I'm elected president I will veto any statute that exempts members of congress. The law should apply evenly to every American. Maria critically when it comes to climate change... ...Our our... Fifty-eight years ago my father fled Cuba. As he stood on the deck of that ferryboat with the wind and salt air blowing he looked back at the oppression and torture he was escaping. And yet he looked forward to the promise of America. His story is our story. What ties Americans together is we are all the children of those who risked everything for freedom. America is in crisis now. I believe in America. And if we get back to the free market principles and constitutional liberties that built this country we can turn this country around. I believe that 2016 will be an election like 1980 that we will win by following Reagan's admonition to paint in bold colors not pale pastels. We're building a grassroots army. I ask you to join us at tedcruz.org. And we the people can turn this nation around."
2015-11-10 00:00:00,paul, Absolutely. And I think that we ought to look where income inequality seems to be the worst. It seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats governors of... States run by Democrats and countries currently run by Democrats. So the thing is let's look for root causes.But I would also say lay some blame at the the feet of the Federal Reserve. I think the Federal Reserve has made this problem worse. By artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest have a tough time making money. They're actually talking now about negative interest.The money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in New York. And because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. So what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality.We also find that as the Federal Reserve destroys the value of the currency what you're finding is that if you're poor if you make $20000 a year and you have three or four kids and you're trying to get by as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks these are the people that are hurt the worst.So really we need to reexamine whether we not we want a Federal Reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates. We also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse.But the bottom line is if you want less income inequality move to a city with a Republican mayor or a state with a Republican governor. Well it's a great question Neil and thanks for including me in the tax debate. I think what's important about the tax debate is is that we have to ask the question where is money best spent in the private sector or in the government sector? I want a government really really small so small you can barely see it. So I want lower taxes and much more money in the private sector. My tax plan however is the only tax plan among any of the candidates on the stage that is part of a balanced budget plan. I put forward three plans that actually balance the budget over a five-year period.Each of these plans have details on exactly where we would cut. The question came up earlier where would you cut? Nobody likes to say where they would cut. I've put pencil to paper and done three budgets that actually balance.I'm also in favor of a plan called the penny plan where we'd just cut 1 percent across the board and the budget actually balances in less than five years. So I think what is extraordinary about my tax plan is it is in the context of balancing the budget. What is also extraordinary about my tax plan is it gets rid of the payroll tax. Democrats demagogue this issue to death and when they do they say oh a millionaire would get a bigger tax cut than someone making $10000. That's proportionality as Ben is trying to explain to folks. But the thing is is if we get rid of the payroll tax everybody is going to get a tax cut. And this is something that I think the public at large will support and could win an election. Ours is 14.5 percent for corporations 14.5 percent for individuals. No payroll tax for the employee. The business tax pays for social security and there would be two remaining deductions home mortgage and charity. Thank you. Neil there's a point I'd like to make here... ....Neil a point that I'd like to make about the tax credits. We have to decide what is conservative and what isn't conservative. Is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion-dollar expenditure? We're not talking about giving people back their tax money. He's talking about giving people money they didn't pay. It's a welfare transfer payment.So here's what we have. Is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments a new welfare program that's a refundable tax credit? Add that to Marco's plan for $1 trillion in new military spending and you get something that looks to me not very conservative. Thank you. Nevertheless it's not very conservative Marco. How is it conservative? Yeah but Marco! Marco! How is it conservative how is it conservative to add a trillion-dollar expenditure for the federal government that you're not paying for? How is it conservative? How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures? You can not be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for. No. I don't think we're any safer I do not think we are any safer from bankruptcy court. As we go further and further into debt we become less and less safe. This is the most important thing we're going to talk about tonight. Can you be a conservative and be liberal on military spending? Can you be for unlimited military spending and say Oh I'm going to make the country safe? No we need a safe country but you know we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined? I want a strong national defense but I don't want us to be bankrupt. Hey Gerard you know we might want to point out China is not part of this deal. Before we get a little bit off-kilter here... There is an argument that China doesn't like the deal because in us doing the deal we'll be trading with their competitors. You're exactly right. But I think we've sort of missed the point a little bit here. There is an important point though about how we discuss these trade treaties that I do agree with Mr. Trump on. We should negotiate from a position of strength. And we also should negotiate using the full force and the constitutional power that was given to us. I think it's a mistake that we give up power to the presidency on these trade deals. We give up the power to filibuster and I'm kind of fond of that power. We give up the power to amend. And I think really one of the big problems we have in our country is over the last century really so much power has gravitated to the executive branch. Really Congress is kind of a bystander. We don't write the rules. We don't make the laws. The executive branch does. So even in trade and I am for trade I think we should be careful about giving so much power to the presidency. I'd like first to respond to the acquisition we should I think it's particularly naive particularly foolish to think that we're not going to talk to Russia. The idea of a no fly zone realize that this is also something that Hillary Clinton agrees with several on our side with you're asking for a no fly zone in an area in which Russia already flies. Russia flies in that zone at the invitation of Iraq. I'm not saying it's a good thing but you better know at least what we're getting into. So when you think it's going to be a good idea to have a no fly zone over Iraq realize that means you are saying we are going to shoot down Russian planes. If you're ready for that be ready to send your sons and daughters to another war in Iraq. I don't want to see that happen. I think the first war in Iraq was a mistake... You can be strong without being involved in every civil war around the war... Ronald Reagan was strong but Ronald Reagan didn't... ...send troops into the Middle East... ...Can I finish... ...Can I finish my time? Could I finish with my time? Yes I would like to finish my response basically. This is an important question. This is an incredibly important question. And the question goes to be who do we want to be our commander-in-chief? Do you want a commander-in-chief who says something that we never did throughout the entire Cold War to discontinue having conversations with the Russians? I am not happy about them flying over there. But I'm not naive enough to say well Iraq has them flying over their airspace we're just going to announce that we're shooting them down?That is naive to the point of being something you might hear in junior high. But it's scary... The first thing I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies. I wouldn't arm ISIS. Most of the people who want to the no-fly zone also favored arming the allies of al Qaeda which became ISIS. That was the dumbest most foolhardy notion. And most of the people up here supported it. They wanted to arm the allies of al Qaeda. Some of them still do.That's how ISIS grew. We pushed back Assad and ISIS was allowed to grow in the vacuum. So the first thing you do is don't arm your enemies. Gerard can I comment... The first thing I would do as president is repeal the regulations that are hampering our energy that the President has put in place. Including the Clean Power Act. While I do think that man may have a role in our climate I think nature also has a role. The planet's 4.5 billion years old we've been through geologic age after geologic age. We've had times when the temperatures been warmer we've had times when the temperatures been colder. We've had times when the carbon in the atmosphere's been higher. So I think before we we need to look before we leap. President's often fond of saying he wants a balance solution but really we do need to balance both keeping the environment clean and we will have some rules for that. We got to balance that with the economy.He's devastated my state. I say the President's not only destroying Kentucky he's destroying the democrat party down there because nobody wants to associate with him. So what we really need is somebody that understands that we do need energy of all forms and that means we will have solar and wind and hydro but we will still have coal and we still will have natural gas. And we've got to have an all of the above policy.But it would be a mistake to shut down all of our industries in the coal fields and shut down the coal power plants. If we did so we're going to have a day where we wake up and some of our big cities are either very cold or very hot. So I think it's a big danger and we shouldn't do it. And what we should do is say we want all of the above... ...We want to free up the energy sector and let people produce let them drill let them explore. We're the richest freest most humanitarian nation in the history of mankind. But we also borrow a million dollars a minute. And the question I have for all Americans is think about it can you be a fiscal conservative if you don't conserve all of the money? If you're a profligate spender you spend money in an unlimited fashion for the military is that a conservative notion? We have to be conservative with all spending domestic spending and welfare spending. I'm the only fiscal conservative on the stage.

2016-03-06 00:00:00,sanders," Anderson thank you very much. Over the last several weeks I had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of Flint at a town meeting in Flint and I have to tell you what I heard and what I saw literally shattered me. And it was beyond belief that children in Flint Michigan in the United States of America in the year 2016 are being poisoned.That is clearly not what this country should be about.As Anderson indicated there's a lot of blame to go around and one of the points that I have made is that I believe the Governor of this state should understand that his dereliction of duty was irresponsible. He should resign. But more importantly what is happening in Flint to a lesser degree is happening throughout this country. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires and increase in income and wealth inequality and all over this country middle class families are struggling. Cities and towns are struggling in order to provide basic services. Among many other things we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure our water systems our waste water plants our roads and our bridges. The wealthiest country in the history of the world has got to get its priorities right take care of the people no more tax breaks for billionaires. What is going is a disgrace beyond belief. As the president of the United States this is what I would do is if local government does not have the resources if state government for whatever reason America shouldn't be poisoned federal government comes in federal government acts. What is absolute incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint. You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington Vermont for clean water.First thing is you say people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive. Second of all to ease anxiety CDC has to come in and examine every child and adult in this community in terms of the amount of lead they may have. Thirdly the wealthiest country has to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure our water systems. I have a bill for a trillion dollars it creates 13 million jobs rebuilding flint Michigan and communities all over the country. That's a good point Anderson. Listen I suppose they can trust the corporations who have destroyed Flint by a disastrous trade policy which have allowed them to shut down plants in flint and move to China or Mexico. We could trust them I'm sure. Or maybe you know maybe Anderson tell you what we should maybe we should let Wall Street come in and run the city of Flint... ...because we know their honesty and integrity has done so much for the American people. Look we live in a democracy and I'm not in the last person to deny that government is failing in many respects.But at the end of the day I will trust the people to create a government that works for them rather than Wall Street or corporate America. President Sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately. And President Sanders would make the point that how does it happen in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? What are our priorities when among others Republicans today are fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people?How did we have so much money available to go to war in Iraq and spend trillions of dollars... ...but somehow not have enough money not just for Flint the secretary is right. There are communities all over this country it's not just infrastructure it is education. Detroit's public school system is collapsing. Anderson the bottom line is and what my campaign is is changing our national priorities. We need a government that works for all of us... ... not just wealthy campaign contributors. I will make a personal promise to you that the EPA and the EPA director that I appoint will make sure that every water system in the United States of America is tested and that the people of those communities know the quality of the water that they are drinking and that we are gonna have a plan to rebuild water systems in this country that are unsafe for drinking. Well I agree you know? We can't sit up here I can't sit up here and make judgment over whether or not somebody committed a criminal act. But I will tell you this that after an investigation if people in fact were found to have committed a criminal act I talked to a mother. Imagine this for a second imagine a mother who had a bright seven-year-old gregarious girl doing well in school. Two years later that child is now in special education intellectual capabilities significantly deteriorated. That is a crime against that child and the people of Flint. And clearly people are going to have to be held accountable. Well first of all that's not quite accurate. I was here long before that. I will you what I did. What I did was meet very quietly in Detroit with parents and others who were impacted by this disaster. And the second thing I did is hold a town meeting which was as nonpolitical as I could make it for hundreds of people to tell me and the world through the media exactly what was happening here in Flint. I think the fear and the legitimate fear of the people of Flint is that a certain point the TV cameras and CNN will disappear. And people are going to be left struggling in order to live in a safe and healthy community. All I can say is if you check my record going back a long time I have stood with those who are hurting. I have stood with those who have no money and I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in the United States of America. That's my record and I'm proud of it. I am very glad Anderson that secretary Clinton discovered religion on this issue but it's a little bit too late. Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America. NAFTA supported by the Secretary cost us 800000 jobs nationwide tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs. Look I was on a picket line in early 1990's against NFATA because you didn't need a PhD in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour. And the reason that I was one of the first not one of the last to be in opposition to the TPP is that American workers... ...should not be forced to compete against people in Vietnam today making a minimum wage of $0.65 an hour. Look what we have got to do is tell corporate America that they cannot continue to shut down. We've lost 60000 factories since 2001. They're going to start having to if I'm president invest in this country not in China not in Mexico. Well I If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout where some of your friends destroyed this economy... ... through excuse me I'm talking. Let me tell my story. You tell yours. Your story is for voting for every disastrous trade agreement and voting for corporate America. Did I vote against the Wall Street bailout? When billionaires on Wall Street destroyed this economy they went to Congress and they said ""please we'll be good boys bail us out."" You know what I said? I said ""let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street."" It shouldn't be the middle class of this country. Wait a minute. Wait. Could I finish? You'll have your turn all right? But ultimately if you look at our records I stood up to corporate America time and time again. I went to Mexico. I saw the lives of people who were working in American factories and making $0.25 an hour.I understood that these trade agreements were going to destroy the middle class of this country. I led the fight against us. That is one of the major differences that we have. I believe that the recklessness the greed and the illegal behavior of Wall Street drove this country into the worst economic downturn in the history of the United modern history of the United States of America. And I will be damned if it was the working people of this country who had to bail out the crooks on Wall Street. And what I proposed and I had an amendment that was defeated it was defeated by a voice vote on the floor of the Senate that said to those people on the top who benefited from Wall Street greed I said ""you pay for the bailout. Don't go to my constituents who are struggling to make ends meet.""In terms of the auto bailout of course that made sense. In terms of the stimulus package of course that made sense and I strongly supported President Obama's position on that. But let us be clear one of the major issues Secretary Clinton says I'm a one-issue person well I guess so. My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. That's my one issue. Let me just say this while we are on Wall Street one of us has a super PAC. One of us has raised $15 million from Wall Street for that super PAC. One of us has given speeches on Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now I kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech it must be a great speech. I think we should release it and let the American people see what that transcript was. All right look Secretary Clinton wants everybody else to release it well I'm your Democratic opponent I release it here it is. There ain't nothing. I don't give speeches to Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars you got it. Second of all when we talk about being tough on Wall Street and this galls me and the American people. Recently Goldman Sachs among many other major financial institutions on Wall Street as you know reached a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion because they were selling worthless packages of subprime mortgages $5 billion settlement.You know how many people executives on Wall Street have gone to jail? If you are a kid caught with marijuana in Michigan you get a police record. If you are an executive on Wall Street that destroys the American economy you pay a $5 billion fine no police record.If I am elected president we are going to bring justice back to a broken criminal justice system. Well I'm blaming the trade policies. You know what? This is an amazing thing which I didn't know until recently and I wonder how many people did know this. Well Hillary Clinton and everybody else who supported these disastrous trade policies. She wasn't alone. We have many many Republicans and far too many Democrats who supported these disastrous trade policies. Do you know... ... Do you know that in 1960 Detroit Michigan was one of the wealthiest cities in America? Flint Michigan was a prosperous city but then what happened is corporate America said why do I want to pay somebody in Michigan a living wage when I can pay slave wages in Mexico or China? We're going to shut down we're going to move abroad we're going to bring those products back into this country.Those trade policies as much as any other set of policies has resulted in the shrinking of the American middle class. And I'll tell you what else it did. It's not only job loss by the millions it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing in some cases today pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago. How stupid is that trade policy? ... I'll tell you what I say... ... I'll tell you what I say. Do you know what the other name of the Export-Import Bank is? What it's called in Washington? It's called the bank of Boeing because Boeing itself gets 40 percent of the money discharged by the Export-Import Bank. Seventy-Five percent of the funds going from the federal government the Export-Import Bank goes to large profitable corporations. Many of these corporations have shut down in America and have gone abroad to exploit poor people.You know what? I don't think it's a great idea for the American taxpayer to have to subsidize through corporate welfare profitable corporations who downsize in the United States of America. ... Seventy-Five percent of that money goes to large profitable corporations. Well let me tell you I don't want to break the bad news. Democrats are not always right. Democrats have often supported corporate welfare... ...Democrats have supported disastrous trade agreements but on this issue I do not believe in corporate welfare and in fact secretary Clinton may know or not know but as a member of the Financial Services Committee I worked hard and successfully to make sure that at least 20 percent of the money went to small businesses which is where it should go and not to profitable corporations and downsizing in our country. Isn't it tragic that the large multinational corporations making billions of dollars a year shutting down in America going to China going to Mexico? Absolutely they need a handout from the American middle class I don't think so. Second of all. Second of all secretary Clinton traveled the world she has been to Europe. And let's talk about Europe versus the United States. I'm sure that when you were in Europe and France and Germany and the U.K. and all of the other countries; you noticed something and that is every one of those countries guarantees health care to all of their people as a right. And I am sure you know as you know you do that in countries like the U.K. compared to America we are spending almost three times as much as they spend in the U.K. for health care for our people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French. When we talk about Europe and their pluses and minuses one thing they have done well that we should emulate and that is guaranteed health care for all people for a better care for all. I remember President Obama being on television maybe three months ago. Showed the secretary members as well. She knows the president I know the president. And he is generally speaking in public and he's not a very emotional guy. And he after the mass killing in Oregon if my memory is correct he said look. There to be honest with you let's be honest. Nobody has a magic solution to this problem. Any lunatic tomorrow any person can walk into a theater and do something horrific. And you know what? For us to tell you that that absolutely will not happen would be untrue. But what the president said he said look this is a tough issue. But we have got to do everything we possibly can to minimize the possibility of these mass killings.You are looking at a guy who comes from a rural state with no gun control. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA. You are looking at a guy who in 1988 lost a statewide election for Congress because I was the only candidate who said you know what I don't think it's a great idea in this country to be selling military-style assault weapons which are designed to kill people. I lost that election by three votes. I agree with what the secretary said. We need to expand and improve the instant background checks. Bottom line is people who should not have guns in America should not be able to buy guns in America. Absolutely I agree. Look that bill had some sensible provisions in it. It had the banning of bullets that pierce policemen's armor. Is that a good thing? I think we would want to get rid of that. particular legislation had safety locks on guns so the kids do not pick them up and shoot them. That bill had bad things in it. What I have said... Absolutely. That was a very arbitrary decision. What that real debate was about as you may or may not know was about how long it would take for the instant background check to go into effect. I wanted that instant background check to go into effect as soon as possible. That was the most important part of that bill. Well this is what I say if I understand it and correct me if I'm wrong. If you go to a gun store and you legally purchase a gun and then three days later if you go out and start killing people is the point of this lawsuit to hold the gun shop owner or the manufacturer of that gun liable? If that is the point I have to tell you I disagree. I disagree because you hold people in terms of this liability thing where you hold manufacturers' liability is if they understand that they're selling guns into an area that it's getting into the hands of criminals of course they should be held liable.But if they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally what you're really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America. I don't agree with that. So let's say this. Let's say this. If I understand and you know as I understand it what you're really talking about is not what Secretary Clinton is responding to. As I understand it and maybe I'm wrong on this but what you were essentially saying and what people are saying is that if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable.And if that is your position then what you are saying essentially if that is the case as I understand it it's not what Secretary Clinton is talking about. I agree with what she said.But if that is the case then essentially your position is there should not be any guns in America period. Can I can I finish please? All right? And you can there are people who hold that view. And that's fine if you hold it. I think what you do is you hold those people who have used the gun accountable. You try to make... ... guns as safe as possible but I would disagree on that. Hold... Hold it. You know I think it is a little bit it is a little bit look what happened at Sandy Hook what happened in Michigan what has happened far too often all over this country is a terrible terrible tragedy and we have got to do everything we can as I mentioned a moment ago to end these mass killings. But as I understand what your question is and you're not the only person whose heart was broken. I know I was there in the Senate when we learned about this killing. It is almost unspeakable to talk about some lunatic walking into a I mean; it is hard to even talk about it.We all feel that way. But it as I understand it Anderson and maybe I'm wrong what you're really talking about is people saying let's end gun manufacturing in America. That's the implications of that and I don't agree with that. Probably will. You know as I think Secretary Clinton knows as we all know there are bills in congress that have bad stuff there are bills in congress that have good stuff. Good stuff and bad stuff in the same bill. Now if I have voted against that bill Secretary Clinton would be here tonight and she'd say ""Bernie Sanders voted against the ban on assault weapons. Bernie Sanders voted against the violence against women act."" Those were provisions in the bill as the Secretary just indicated. So in that bill there was some good provisions I have been a fierce fighter against domestic violence ever since I was mayor in Burlington.Violence against women act has protected millions of women in this country it was in that bill. The ban on assault weapons that's what I have fought for my whole life. It was in that bill.Now what you are reading though is I went to the floor as I recall and that's what I said. I tried to get the death penalty aspects in that bill out. Secretary Clinton have a disagreement. I was then and I am now opposed to the death penalty. So to answer your question what you read was a congressman who was torn who said there are good things in that bill there are bad things overall. I voted for it.But where we are right now is having more than 2.2 million people in jail more than any other country on earth. This is a campaign promise at the end of my first term we will not have more people in jail than any other country. You are not talking about me are you? Well I think the best answer I don't know that I can give you a definitive answer here but I will give you this answer. When I was a young man at the University of Chicago I worked with fellow black and white students trying to desegregate the University of Chicago owned housing. Most candidates for president don't put this on their resume but I was arrested by the Chicago police for trying to desegregate the Chicago school system. In 1963 and an important day for me I went to the march on Washington led by Dr. King for jobs and freedom. Dr. King has been an important inspiration for me. In this campaign if you go toberniesanders.com and read our position on criminal justice it is I believe the strongest position of any candidate. What it says among other things 51 percent of African-American kids today are unemployed you know we're going to do? We're going to provide education and jobs for those kids not jails or incarceration."
2016-03-06 00:00:00,cooper," And welcome to The Whiting Auditorium on the campus of the Flint Cultural Center in Flint Michigan for a special CNN democratic presidential debate. I'm Anderson Cooper. I want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. Tonight's debate will be seen on CNN CNN International CNN en Espanol by American soldiers sailors and airmen on the American Forces Network and nationwide on the Westwood One Radio Network.And now we want to welcome the Democratic candidates for president of the United States please welcome Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Please welcome former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Ladies and gentlemen the Democratic candidates for president of the United States! Before we begin tonight we want to take a moment to remember former first lady Nancy Reagan. As probably know she passed away this morning at the age of 94. Her grace and elegance in the White House her deep love for President Reagan and her strength and advocacy in the fight against Alzheimer's and drug abuse will always be remembered. We would like to pause of a moment of silence in honor of Mrs. Reagan.And now will you please rise for our national anthem performed by the Flint City Wide Choir conducted by Darnell Ishmel. Our thanks to the Flint City Wide Choir. Candidates take your positions behind the podium. Before we begin as the candidates take their positions I just want to set out some ground rules as moderators I'll ask questions I'll ask follow- ups and guide the discussion. The candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions. They'll have 30 seconds for follow- ups. CNN's Don Lemon will join me in the questioning as will members of our audience here tonight. The members of our audience are Democrats and independents from Flint and elsewhere in Michigan. We've reviewed their questions just so they don't overlap. Now we've come to Flint because this is a city in crisis a city where as you probably know the tap water is toxic. Public servants public institutions not only failed to prevent the crisis their decisions created this crisis. The state of Michigan in an effort to save money switched Flint's water source to a cheaper but riskier alternative the Flint River. Safeguards were ignored. That river water corroded residential pipes and for nearly two years lead leaked into the water used in people's homes. Now for much of that time the state downplayed the danger even in the face of growing complaints and physical evidence.For 100 days the federal government knew about it and yet in all that time nobody told the people of Flint. They bathed in the water they drank it and so did their kids. Even today lead is still present in some of the water.Tonight the Democratic candidates are here to answer questions about what they would do for Flint as well as about other issues facing their country right now.Each candidate has one minute for an opening statement Senator Sanders is first. We begin with him. Senator Sanders? Thank you Senator. Secretary Clinton? Secretary Clinton? We're going to have a lot of time for that. We want to begin tonight with the people of Flint themselves. This is Mikki Wade she's a public housing program manager and the mother of two kids. She says she's currently undecided and has a question that both of you will be able to weigh in on. Ms. Wade? Secretary Clinton we'll begin with you. Secretary Clinton let me follow-up with that he people here still wasn't drink the water in their homes as you well know. They can't bathe their kids in the water and they are desperate for accountability and specifics. As president can you give a specific about what you can do if you were president that would make Ms. Wade's life better and life better for people here? Senator Sanders for Ms. Wade specifically? Thank you senator. We will have more on the infrastructure shortly but I want to follow up with you.This crisis in flint as you know as everybody in the room knows was created by the government. Your policies are about expanding government. Why should people from flint trust that more government is the answer? Secretary Clinton Secretary Clinton you you've now both called for the governor to resign. I believe that's that's new for you. Previously you had not called for that but you're calling for that tonight. It's easy to blame the Republican governor Rick Snyder. But the federal government also dropped the ball here. According to Section 1414 of the Safe Drinking Water Act the EPA has to step in and take action when a state is informed at about water problems and doesn't do anything for 30 days as the state here didn't do.The EPA knew for months and months never warned the people of Flint not to drink the water. As president would you fire the head of the EPA? So far one person has resigned. Senator Sanders would a President Sanders fire the head of the EPA? Thank you thank you Senator. Thank you Senator. I want to go to Lee-Anne Walters. This is Lee-Anne Walters. She was one of the first people to report problems with the water in Flint. One of her twin boys stopped growing. Her daughter lost her hair. She says she's undecided and has a question for both of you to answer but we'll start with Senator Sanders. Ms. Walters? Let me just point out for accuracy's sake there is 10 million lead service pipes delivering water to people all across this country tonight. Secretary Clinton? Thank you. ... Thank you... Thank you Secretary. I want to go to my colleague Don Lemon. Thank you Senator. Thank you Secretary. I want to turn now to Bryn Mickle the editor of the Flint Journal he's our local partner in this debate. He has our next question.Bryn? Bryn has a follow up. Thank you Senator. This city is also facing a jobs crisis 75 percent of Flint's manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last 25 years and about the same amount of time Michigan lost 230000 manufacturing jobs.I want to go to Tanisha Motron she grew up in flint and now works in Detroit at the Shinola watch factory which as you know is often held up as the blueprint for how to save American industry jobs. She says she's leaning towards secretary Clinton and has a question for her. Secretary Clinton? Senator sanders I will let you... Secretary Clinton? Let him . Secretary Clinton? Secretary Clinton. Senator Sanders? Senator Sanders... Senator Sanders just yesterday in fact you said just I believe it was yesterday you said not only her speech must have been a fantastic speech it must have been a Shakespearean speech for that amount of money. Is her answer enough for you that she will release it when all the Republicans and Democrats do? Secretary Clinton? Senator Sanders I just want to show the audience you sent a tweet I want to return to trade. You sent a tweet on Thursday this is the tweet I'm showing it to viewers. It says the people of Detroit know the real costs of Hillary Clinton's free trade policies. It shows pictures of crumbling buildings. It seems like you're blaming her for the situation in Detroit. But you're calling them Hillary Clinton's failed trade policies. Secretary Clinton? ... Senator Sanders... ... I just want to explain to viewers what the Export- Import Bank is in case everybody is not quite as wonkish as everybody on this stage here. The Export-Import Bank it's a federal agency it gives loans to companies that export American products. Senator Sanders you do oppose it. The vast majority of the bank's customers are small businesses 176 right here in Michigan. What do you say to small business owners.... ... Who rely on the banks to make their company profitable... Senator... Senator Sanders you are the only member of the Democratic caucus to vote against it. You're agreeing with Senator Ted Cruz on this why is he right and the Democrats wrong? Secretary Clinton? I'm going to let you respond but I just want to push back on this. Senator Sanders is correct the majority of the money does go Boeing does go to companies like Caterpillar. Do they need this money? Thank you. Senator sanders? Thank you Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton 30 seconds and we have to take a break. So 30 seconds if you can. We have to take a break. We will continue this discussion. We have a lot more to talk about. We will take a short break. We have more of the Presidential Democratic Debate from Flint Michigan when we come back. And welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate live here in Flint Michigan. We want to continue the discussion now we're gonna turn to the subject of crime. As most of you know two weeks ago an Uber driver in Kalamazoo which is two hours from where we are tonight went on a shooting rampage killing six people injuring two people.One of the injured was a 14-year-old girl. Her name is Abigail Kopf. She was shot in the head her heart stopped she was on life support looked like she might might not make it. But amazingly Abigail pulled through. Her father... ...her father Gene Kopf is here tonight. And I know Gene you have a question. But before you ask your question I just want to ask how is Abigail doing tonight? I should point out you are leaning toward Senator Sanders but I know you have a question that applies to both candidates. We'll first toss it to Secretary Clinton. What's your question? Secretary Clinton? Thank you. I want to go to Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders? Senator Sanders Secretary Clinton mentioned the so- called Charleston loophole. What she is calling the Charleston loophole. Is that something if you were president you would you work to extend that three day? So you would want a longer than three days waiting period? Secretary Clinton actually Senator Sanders let me continue to follow-up because Secretary Clinton mentioned the liability. Right now families of Sandy Hook victims announced that they are going to sue Remington who made the AR-15 which was used in the Newtown massacre. Now they believe those families believe that that Remington the distributors the sellers should be held legally responsible for how that gun how their product is used.Now the lawsuit may not go anywhere because of the bill you voted for legislation that prevents gun makers from being sued. Tonight what do you say to those families? Secretary Clinton? Secretary... ... Secretary... Senator Sanders. We're gonna move on. We're gonna move on. Dawn... Senator Sanders... Senator Sanders. We're going to move on. Don Lemon? Thank you very much. I want to go to David Mcghee. David Mcghee runs a youth development program director and he is undecided but his question is for Senator Sanders. David? In a speech about policing the FBI director borrowed a phrase from Avenue Q saying"" everybody is a little racist."" So on a personal front what racial blind spots do you have?"
2016-03-06 00:00:00,question, The water has impacted our lives in such a way that living comfortably in our home isn't the same anymore. The constant drives to pick up water just so my children can wash their hair to wash our fruits and vegetables and to brush our teeth is incredibly difficult. Once the pipes are replaced I'm not so sure I would be comfortable ever drinking the water. If elected president what course will you take to regain my trust in the government? After my family the city of Flint and the children in D.C. were poisoned by lead will you make a personal promise to me right now that as president in your first 100 days in office you will make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States and notification made to the the citizens that have said service lines. Secretary Clinton it took this water crisis for politicians like yourself to notice we are a city in trouble. You've only both recently started talking about Flint holding campaign events here in just the past few weeks. Secretary Clinton you've even made the crisis a centerpiece of a new campaign ad. Why should the people of Flint believe that you aren't just using this crisis to secure political points? Senator Sanders how about you? Your first visit to Flint as a presidential candidate was just over a week ago. That's almost five months after the people here were told to stop drinking the water. What took you so long? A lot of members work in the auto industry here in Flint. That's ultimately what I wanted to do when I got out of school unfortunately I was unable to get any one of the big three and that's why I now reside at Shinola. If you are elected president what are you going to do to in the United States instead of sending them overseas to other countries? She is now laughing and giggling but she has a long road of physical recovery. The United States has had a rash of mass shootings over the years 42 shootings in the United States this year alone. The man who shot everyone including my daughter in Kalamazoo had no mental health issues recorded and had a clear background. What do you plan to do to address this serious epidemic? I don't want to hear anything about tougher laws for mental health or criminal backgrounds because that doesn't work. Thank you. We live in a diverse nation. Opportunities to lead however to be frank are often at the feet at older Caucasian men and women. Men more so than women. However what experiences do you have that have helped you deeply understand the mind sets and values of other cultures?

2016-03-06 00:00:00,clinton," Well I'll start by saying amen to that. We are here in Flint I'm very grateful that my request that we hold this debate be held here so we can continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city.I agree the Governor should resign or be recalled... ... support the efforts of citizens attempting to achieve that. But that is not enough. We have to focus on what must be done to help the people of Flint.I support a hundred percent the efforts by your senators and members of congress to get the money from the federal government in order to begin the work that must occur to fix the infrastructure. The state should also be sending money immediately to help this city. I know the state of Michigan has a rainy day fund for emergencies what is more important than the health and wellbeing of the people particularly children? It is raining lead in Flint and the state is derelict in not coming forward with the money that is required. And we'll get to what we need to do to help the children and the people when I have a little more time because that's just as important as fixing the pipes. Well Nikki it's a very fair question. Your government at all levels have let you and your children and the people of Flint down. So I think that there are there several things. All the repair work that is being done and Mayor Weaver program that we support to begin to help train people in Flint to be able to do this work to distribute the water. Everything that is done has to be triple checked to regain your trust and to hold those who are responsible for fixing the pipes and delivering the clean water which has you said you bathe in it and drink it and wash food in it. You do everything with it.Every one of us should have to run through in our minds how we use water every single day to understand the pressures and the real pain that families are going through. So I will make sure as President that I double and triple check. I will work with elected officials who I trust like your mayor and like your senators and member of Congress so that we can assure you that when it's fixed you can trust it. You deserve nothing less. Well I support what President Obama is doing. He called for and got accountability from the officials at the EPA to make sure the state is doing its job. He expanded Medicaid for helping kids particularly to get the health care they need. He is also ordered that there be a Head Start program. I support that. When it comes to the water itself we are supporting a program that Mayor Waver announced through Flint Waterworks to pay people in Flint not outsiders but people here to deliver the water while we are fixing the pipes. I would do even more of that. As president what we were able to put together was a beginning. As president I would concentrate resources on the city for economic development for more jobs as we fix the water and provide the health and education interventions that children need. Well I think that the people here in the region who knew about this and failed to follow what you just said rightly the law required have been eliminated from the EPA. I don't well I don't know how high it goes. I would certainly be launching an investigation. I think there is one. I was told that you know some of the higher-ups were pushing to get changes that were not happening. So I would have a full investigation determine who knew what when. And yes people should be fired. How far up it went I don't know. But as far as it goes they should be relieved because they failed this city.But let me just add this Anderson. This is not the only place where this kind of action is needed. We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water including lead are way above what anybody should tolerate. We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So I'm not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board. And if people know about it and they're not acting and they're in the government at any level they should be forced to resign. Well I agree completely. I want to go further though. I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it's not only in water systems it's also in soil and it's in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes. That's why 500000 children today have lead lead in their bodies. So I want to do exactly what you said. We will commit to a priority to change the water systems and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere.We were making progress on this in the 1990's. I worked with then Senator Obama to get more money more support to do more to remove lead. That has unfortunately been in many ways moved to a lower priority. I will elevate it and I will do everything I can. Water soil and paint... ... We're going to get rid of it. Well that's going to be up to the legal system Don. I mean I can't standing here I don't have all the facts but people should be held accountable wherever that leads. If it leads to resignation or recall if you're in political office. If it leads to civil penalties if it leads to criminal responsibility. There has to be an absolute accountability and I will support whatever the outcome of those investigations are. Well I think because throughout my public career I have been evening the odds for people in every way that I could. I started out with the Children's Defense Fund I worked throughout my time as a young lawyer as a person an activist. Certainly in Arkansas then in the White House to try to fix problems wherever I saw them. And this problem is one that is particularly outrageous and painful at the same time.So when I heard about it I immediately sent people here to find out what was going on. It was almost unbelievable. We have this problem in other places but we don't say that it was actually caused by decisions made by public officials in positions of authority as this one was.Then when I talked to the mayor I basically said ""What can I do to help?""Then when I came here and I met with some of the mothers and met their children and heard their stories I'm just determined to do whatever I can. So I have put together resources from the private and philanthropic communities to help provide a bridge because you've got to get the federal money you've got to get the state money but I'm going to do everything I can. And I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis in whatever capacity I am.And if I'm president it will always be a priority for action from me. I'm going to do what I think will work which is both carrots and sticks. Let me talk about the carrots. We're going to have a very clear set of proposals and incentives for manufacturing so that we change the way that companies think about making investments again in America. I have a comprehensive manufacturing plan that I will be implementing. We're also going to invest more on infrastructure as we both have said ""it's woefully under resourced."" That will put a lot of people to work. I want to do more to help small businesses they are the source of two thirds of our jobs and we have to help them start and grow particularly minority and women-owned small businesses.We need to do more to help create clean energy as a source of good jobs but I am also going to go after companies. You know when a company decides to leave like Nabisco is leaving and they have gotten tax benefits from Chicago and Illinois to stay there I will claw back the benefits. They will have to pay them back if they are leaving a place that actually invested in them.I am also going to go after companies like Johnson Controls in Wisconsin. They came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier and now they want to move headquarters to Europe. They are going to have to pay an exit fee. We are going to stop this kind of job exporting and we are going to start importing and growing jobs again in our country. Well well I'll tell you something else that Senator Sanders was against. He was against the auto bailout. In January of 2009 President-Elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout. The money was there and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and four million jobs and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference. You know... If you're gonna talk tell the whole story Senator Sanders. I will. OK so... Well if I if I could... ...to set the record straight I voted against the only multinational trade agreement that came before me when I was in the Senate. It was called CAFTA. I came out against the TPP after it was finished. I thought it was reasonable to actually know what was in it before I opposed it. I oppose it. Now let me get back to what happened in January of 2009. The Bush administration negotiated the deal. Were there things in it that I didn't like? Would I have done it differently? Absolutely.But was the auto bailout money in it the $350 billion that was needed to begin the restructuring of the auto industry? Yes it was. So when I talk about Senator Sanders being a one-issue candidate I mean very clearly you have to make hard choices when you're in positions of responsibility. The two senators from Michigan stood on the floor and said ""we have to get this money released."" I went with them and I went with Barack Obama. You did not. If everybody had voted the way he did I believe the auto industry would have collapsed taking four million jobs with it. Well all I can say is that given the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing I think it was the right decision to heed what President-elect Obama asked us to do. He sent a letter an authorized letter asking us to support that to save the auto industry. Yes were there things in it that you and I would not have necessarily wanted? That's true. But when it came down to it you were either for saving the auto industry or you were against it. I voted to save the auto industry. And I am very glad that I did. And I have said and I will say again I will be happy to release anything I have as long as everybody else does too because what really is behind that question Republicans and Democrats is where I can stand up to Wall Street. Well let's have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change. I went to Wall Street when I was a United States senator. I told them they were wrecking the economy. I asked for a moratorium on foreclosures. I asked that we do more to try to prevent what I worried was going to happen. I also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole. I also called for changes in CEO pay. I have a record. And you know what if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on Wall Street if you ever took money President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the Great Depression with the Dodd-Frank regulations. Well I think we are in vigorous agreement on this. I have said repeatedly no bank is too big to fail no executive too powerful to jail. And I have said that I would use the tools in the Dodd-Frank regulations that if any bank posed a systemic risk to the economy they would be broken up. Because we now have tools laws that we didn't have before. And I am very happy we did. Because there does need to be accountability including criminal accountability if it is called for. You know if we're going to argue about the 1990's instead of talking about the future which I'd much prefer because I think every election is about the future and you all deserve to know what we will do to help you have a brighter future but if we are going to talk about the 1990's I think it's only fair to say that at the end of the 1990's after two terms of my husband's presidency the unemployment rate in Michigan was 4.4 percent. There had been a net increase of 54000 manufacturing jobs. There had been a net increase of 653000 jobs overall.And one of the ways jobs were brought to and grown here in Michigan was through something called the Export-Import Bank which helped a lot of businesses particularly small businesses be able to export around the world.Senator Sanders opposes that. I think we're in a race for exports. I think China Germany everybody else supports their businesses. Here in Michigan there's been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports primarily from small businesses.I favor that he's opposed it. I want to do everything I can for us to compete and win in the global economy... ... and that's what I will do as president... When I traveled around the world on you behalf as Secretary of State and went to 112 countries one thing I saw everywhere was how European and Asian countries were supporting their companies back in their countries to be able to make sales and contracts in a lot of the rest of the world. In fact without the export-import bank supporting businesses of all sizes I believe more jobs would be lost here at home and more jobs literally would be exported. Instead of exporting products we would be exporting jobs. I just believe that Senator Sanders took that lonely position because most of us who saw the results I saw it as a senator from New York. Your Senators saw it here in Michigan. They can give you the names of 240 companies in Michigan that have been helped.There is a company in Levonia being helped there are companies all over this state. I know if we are going to compete and win in the global economy we can't let every other country support their companies and we take a hands off approach. I will not agree with that. I will tell you what Anderson after I investigated it I concluded they did and here's why. There two big plane manufacturers in the world there's Airbus and Boeing. Airbus does everything it can to get contracts to sell planes everywhere in the world. We don't have as quite an aggressive outreach from our government. I did go in many places around the world to sell American products because the alternatives were usually European Asian primarily Chinese products. That to me was an unacceptable concession. So yes Boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support. We are on the path to doing that thanks to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act we have 90 percent coverage. We are lacking 10 percent. We are going to stay on that and get to 100 percent universal coverage. Well first of all I am looking at your daughter and I'm very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery. But it never should have happened. You know on average 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country. I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms. The Brady Bill which has been in effect now for about 23 years has kept more than two million purchases from going forward. So we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile.But the comprehensive background checks closing the gun show loophole closing the online loophole closing what's called the Charleston loophole where you get a gun at the end of three days even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in Charleston did. And then they found out later he shouldn't have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at Mother Emmanuel Church.I also believe so strongly Gene that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake. Because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers. And it also disrupted what was a very promising legal theory to try to get makers to do more to make guns safer for example. To try to give sellers more accountability for selling guns when they shouldn't have. So that is an issue that Senator Sanders and I differ on I voted against giving them immunity but I think we should very seriously move to repeal that and go back to making sure gun makers and sellers are like any other business. They can be held accountable.And then I do think we have got to have a public... Well we've got to have a public discussion because we have created a culture in which people grab for guns all the time. And there has got to be a way to have more warning signals and more efforts to try to stop that from happening like with the man who shot your daughter. Well that that is not that is not what happened and I think it's important for people to understand. Because of the proliferation of guns because of the epidemic of gun violence in our country there were a group of cities states and other concerned people who in the late 90s and in the early 2000s were working on legal theories that they thought would force gun makers to do more to make guns safer and force sellers to be much more responsible.The NRA saw this happening and they said ""we've got to stop it. Last thing in the world we want is to have guns that you can only shoot with your fingerprint or to have guns with such strong safety locks on them that they may not be sellable.""So the NRA went to the Congress and the head of the NRA has said this was the most important NRA legislation in more than 20 years... ... and they basically went to the Congress I was there. I was in the Senate. And they said ""give us absolute immunity."" No other industry in America has absolute immunity... ...and they sell products all the time that cause harm... ... and they're held responsible. That is like the NRA position. No. Anderson I just want to finish because this I know some of the parents from Sandy Hook. I want people in this audience to think about what it must feel like to send off your first grader little backpack maybe on his or her back and then the next thing you hear is that somebody has come to that school using an automatic weapon an AR-15 and murdered those children. Now they are trying to prevent that from happening to any other family. And the best way to do that is to go right at the people... ... you talk about corporate greed? The gun manufacturers sell guns to make as much money as they can make. Well Don't let me say this Senator Sanders voted for that bill we both supported it. And I think it's fair to say we did because back then there was an outcry over the rising crime rate and people from all communities were asking that action be taken. Now my husband said at the NAACP last summer that it solved some problems but it created other problems and I agree. And one of those problems was unfortunately a move to expand the reasons why people would be incarcerated not just at the federal level which is what this bill about but in states and localities as well. And that's why the very first speech that I gave in this campaign was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration because I believe absolutely that too many families were broken up too many communities were adversely affected. So we've got to do a bunch of things.On the criminal justice side look we've got to have better policing. That means body cameras that means ending profiling that means doing everything we can to make sure there's respect between the community and the police.And when it comes to incarceration... ... That means we have to limit mandatory minimums we have to end disparities and treatment at last through incarceration... Well Senator Sanders voted for it as well. Are you going to ask him the same question? I just said that. He said at the NAACP that there were some aspects that worked well. The violence against women provisions have worked well for example. But other aspects of it were a mistake and I agree. That's why I'm focused and have a very comprehensive approach toward fixing the criminal justice system going after systemic racism that stalks the criminal justice system ending private prisons ending the incarceration of low-level offenders and I am committed to doing that. Let me go answer Mr. Mcghee's question because I think it's a profound one. I think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when I was a teenager insisting that we go in to inner-city Chicago because I lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives and to hear Dr. King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old. That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith.When I was in law school I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman named Mary Right Adelman who worked with Dr. King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar. I asked her for a job and she said she didn't have any money. I was working my way through law school and she said if I could get a job and get myself paid she would give me a job. So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant.The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies. So from that moment until today I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Children's Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism. Well Don if I could I think being a white person in the United States of America I know that I have never had the experience that so many people the people in this audience have had. And I think it's incumbent upon me and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have ""the talk"" with your kids scared that your sons or daughters even could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever like Sandra Bland and end up dead in a jail in Texas. And I have spent a lot of time with the mothers of African-American children who have lost them Trayvon Martin's mother. And I've gotten to know them. I've listened to them. And it has been incredibly humbling because I can't pretend to have the experience that you have had and others have had. But I will do everything that I possibly can to not only do the best to understand and to empathize but to tear down the barriers of systemic racism that are in the criminal justice system in the employment system in the education and health care system.That is what I will try to do to deal with what I know is the racism that still stalks our country."
2016-03-06 00:00:00,lemon," Anderson thank you very much. Secretary Clinton tonight you call for the resignation or for Governor Snyder to be recalled. There are residents of this city who want to see criminal charges brought against those who are responsible. Do you think people should go to jail? Senator Sanders do you think people should go to jail? Alright thank you very much Anderson. As a black man in America if I were born today I'd have a one in three chance of ending up in prison in my life. Secretary Clinton on the campaign trail you are calling for an end to the era of mass incarceration but a lot of folks in the black community blame the 1994 Crime Bill a bill you supported for locking up a generation of black men.Given what's happened since 1994 why should black people trust you to get it right this time? But Secretary... The question is why should black people trust you this time to get it right? That's the question. Do you think your support your husband has said that this bill was a mistake. Do you think it was a mistake? And Senator Sanders before you respond I want to ask you this. Back in 1994 here's what you warned we are dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness mystery hopelessness drugs crime and violence but you voted for the bill anyway. Was your vote a mistake? I want to ask both of you this question. I appreciate you responding to that question but I want to ask both of you again. In a speech about policing the FBI director James Comey borrowed a phrase saying ""everyone is a little bit racist."" What racial blind spot do you have? Secretary you first. Thank you Secretary. Senator Sanders on a personal front what racial blind spots do you have?"
2015-10-28 00:00:00,huckabee," Well John I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of. But my wife is down here in the front and I'm sure if you'd like to talk to her later she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.If I have a weakness it's that I try to live by the rules. I try to live by the rules no matter what they are and I was brought up that way as a kid. Play by the rules.And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by. Well I would really appreciate that. First of all yes we've stolen. Yes we've lied to the American people about Social Security and Medicare. But you know what we're not telling them? It's their money. This isn't the governments money. This is not entitlement it's not welfare. This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks. Everytime they got a paycheck the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it. Now we're going to blame the people.Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money. That makes no sense to everybody. And they're always going to say ""Well we're going to fix this one day.""No their not. It's like a 400 pound man saying ""I'm going to go on a diet but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do.""And people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this. But let me tell you who not to blame. Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security. Let's quit making it a problem for them. It's like them getting mugged and then us saying well we're going to mug you some more. You ought to just be able to get over it get used to it... ...No sir... ...we need to honor our promises... ...before I go. This is the only time I've had a chance let me finish. ...This is a matter not of math this is a matter of morality. If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep? And the fact is none of them. : And by the way Carl... And the only way no... ...Chris... ...Chris... Since he brought me up do I not get to respond? John listen let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income. And when I hear people talking about means testing let's just remember what that means. If we means test Social Security it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it. If a person lives in a seven room house does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms we're going to take two of them away? Folks the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in. I just want to remind you people paid their money. They expect to have it. And if this government doesn't pay it than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country. Well John I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.

2015-10-28 00:00:00,cramer, Dr. Carson in recent weeks a number of pharmaceutical companies has been accused of profiteering for dramatically raising the prices of life-saving drugs. You have spent a lifetime in medicine. Have these companies gone too far? Should the government be involved in controlling some of these price increases? Thank you Dr. Carson. Governor Christie there has been a lot of political rhetoric that some bank executives should have gone to jail for the 2008 financial crisis.But General Motors paid more than $1 billion in fines and settlements for its ignition switch defect. One hundred and twenty- four people died as a result of these faulty switches. No one went to jail.As a former prosecutor do you believe the people responsible for the switch and the cover-up belong behind bars? Thank you Governor Christie.

2015-10-28 00:00:00,trump," I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much. I'm too trusting. And when they let me down if they let me down I never forgive. I find it very very hard to forgive people that deceived me. So I don't know if you would call that a weakness but my wife said ""let up."" Right. Right. That's right. No not a comic book and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that. Larry Kudlow is an example who I have a lot of respect for who loves my tax plan. We're reducing taxes to 15 percent. We're bringing corporate taxes down bringing money back in corporate inversions. We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.As far as the wall is concerned we're going to build a wall. We're going to create a border. We're going to let people in but they're going to come in legally. They're going to come in legally. And it's something that can be done and I get questioned about that. They built the great wall of China. That's 13000 miles. Here we actually need 1000 because we have natural barriers. So we need 1000.We can do a wall. We're going to have a big fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall. We're going to have people come in but they're coming in legally. And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders but the leaders are much sharper smarter and more cunning than our leaders.And just to finish people say how will you get Mexico to pay? A politician other than the people in the states I don't want to a politician cannot get them to pay. I can. We lose we have a trade imbalance...Excuse me John.... of $50 billion... ... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison. Right. Dynamically. Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow who sits on your panel who's a great guy who came out the other day and said I love Trump's tax plan. First of all John got lucky with a thing called fracking OK? He hit oil. He got lucky with fracking. Believe me that is why Ohio is doing well. Number and that is important for you to know. Number two this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it including Ben and myself because I was there and I watched what happened.And Lehman Brothers started it all. He was on the board. And he was a managing general partner.And just thirdly he was so nice. He was such a nice guy. And he said oh I'm never going to attack. But then his poll numbers tanked. He has got that is why he is on the end. And he got nasty. And he got nasty. So you know what? You can have him. I think you're Well first of all like many other very big businessmen I could name them here but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons but the biggest and almost all of them they've all used the chapter laws the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit. Before this I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman. Atlantic City has gone bad. I mean Chris will know about that. I'm not blaming Chris by the way but he will know about that. Caesar's excuse me Caesar's the Rolls-Royce as you know is in bankruptcy. Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy the biggest.But also the biggest people (ph) now I've used that to my advantage as a business man for my family for myself. I never filed for bankruptcy. But many many people did. What happened with Atlantic City is very very disgraceful.Now hundreds of companies I've opened. I've used it three times maybe four times. Came out great. But I guess I'm supposed to come out great. That is what I could do for the country. We owe $19 trillion boy am I good at solving debt problems. Nobody can solve it like me.But I will tell you this Atlantic City you're using that hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived. I built a net worth of way over $10 billion and I have done it four times out of hundreds. And I'm glad I did it.I used the laws of the country to my benefit I'm sorry. Thank you. I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much. I'm too trusting. And when they let me down if they let me down I never forgive. I find it very very hard to forgive people that deceived me. So I don't know if you would call that a weakness but my wife said ""let up."" Right. Right. That's right. No not a comic book and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that. Larry Kudlow is an example who I have a lot of respect for who loves my tax plan. We're reducing taxes to 15 percent. We're bringing corporate taxes down bringing money back in corporate inversions. We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.As far as the wall is concerned we're going to build a wall. We're going to create a border. We're going to let people in but they're going to come in legally. They're going to come in legally. And it's something that can be done and I get questioned about that. They built the great wall of China. That's 13000 miles. Here we actually need 1000 because we have natural barriers. So we need 1000.We can do a wall. We're going to have a big fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall. We're going to have people come in but they're coming in legally. And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders but the leaders are much sharper smarter and more cunning than our leaders.And just to finish people say how will you get Mexico to pay? A politician other than the people in the states I don't want to a politician cannot get them to pay. I can. We lose we have a trade imbalance...Excuse me John.... of $50 billion... ... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison. Right. Dynamically.

2015-10-28 00:00:00,rubio, Thank you for that question. I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that today is eroding from too many of our people. I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us. And that doesn't have to be true.Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now. If we're willing to do what it takes now the 21st century is going to be the new American century greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation. That's an interesting question. That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too. Why don't you wait in line? Wait for what? This country is running out of time. We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years. Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck. They're working as hard as they ever have everything costs more and they haven't had a raise in decades.You have small businesses in America that are struggling. For the first time in 35 years we have more businesses closing than starting. We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies. And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.We have a they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington? We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.The time to act is now. The time to turn the page is now. If we if we don't act now we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves. Let me say I read that editorial today with a great amusement. It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today. Let me let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today. Back in 2004 one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham a Democrat ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I don't recall them calling for his resignation Later that year in 2004 John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. I don't recall the Sun in fact the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008 Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement. I get to respond right? Well it's interesting. Over the last few weeks I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that carrying your own bag at the airport. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after? No Jeb I don't remember well let me tell you. I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record. The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you. Here's the bottom line. I'm not my campaign is going to be about the future of America it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. I'm not running against Governor Bush I'm not running against anyone on this stage. I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama. Well you just you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all. But I'm going to tell you the truth. Here's the truth. I didn't inherit any money. My dad was a bartender my mother was a maid. They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.They didn't save enough money for us to go to school. I had to work my way through school. I had to borrow money to go to school. I tried (ph) early in my marriage explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1000 out of our bank account every month. I know what it's like to owe that money and we've worked hard. We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family a better life for our family.We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in. My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.But I'm not worried about my finances I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more. And that's what this economy needs to that's what this debate needs to be about.This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about. And I used it to pay off my loans. And it's available on paperback if you're interested in buying my book. Yeah again as I said we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan. It increases the per child tax credit because I didn't read about this in a book. I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children how expensive it's become for working families. And I make a lot more than the average American. Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40 50 $60000 a year and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.We can't afford another four years of that. Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.Thank you senator. Thank you for that question. I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that today is eroding from too many of our people.

2015-10-28 00:00:00,christie, I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage quite frankly. Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage. You know I see a socialist an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me I can't figure out which one is which. But I will but I will tell you this the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it. The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.But I know who the pessimist is. It's Hillary Clinton. And you put me on that stage against her next September she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. Take it to the bank. Well I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it. I mean let me be honest with the people who are watching at home. The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you. They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund. All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago. And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years. We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements and debt service. And that's with zero percent interest rates.Now I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements. And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. And here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton. What Hillary Clinton's going to say and has said before is she wants to raise Social Security taxes.Now let me ask you a question everybody and this is for the guy you know who owns a landscaping business out there. If somebody's already stolen money from you are you going to give them more? Or are you going to deal with the problem by saying I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend. We need to get realistic about this. We're not the American people forget about anything else they've already been lied to and stolen from. And... ...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it... ...The only way we're going to be morale the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow which is to look at them treat them like adults and tell them the truth. It isn't there anymore Mike. They stole it. It got stolen from them. It's not theirs anymore. The government stole it and spent it a long time ago... So let's stop fooling around about this let's tell people the truth. For once let's do that and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true. You bet they do. And if I were the prosecutor that is exactly where they would be. The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department. It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are. They like General Motors so they give them a pass. They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace. It's a political Justice Department.And Jim you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies. We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders. We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.And to expand on Mr. Carson's or Dr. Carson's question let's face it we have laws already. We don't need newer (ph) laws. We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for again does anybody out there think that giving Washington D.C. the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea given how well they have done running the government?So what we do though is if there is somebody who is price- gouging we have laws for prosecutors to take that on. Let's let a Justice Department and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word. It will be a way of life. I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage quite frankly. Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage. You know I see a socialist an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me I can't figure out which one is which. But I will but I will tell you this the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it. The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.But I know who the pessimist is. It's Hillary Clinton. And you put me on that stage against her next September she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. Take it to the bank.

Or are you going to deal with the problem by saying I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend. We need to get realistic about this. We're not the American people forget about anything else they've already been lied to and stolen from. And... ...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it... ...The only way we're going to be morale the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow which is to look at them treat them like adults and tell them the truth. It isn't there anymore Mike. They stole it. It got stolen from them. It's not theirs anymore. The government stole it and spent it a long time ago... So let's stop fooling around about this let's tell people the truth. For once let's do that and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true. You bet they do. And if I were the prosecutor that is exactly where they would be. The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department. It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are. They like General Motors so they give them a pass. They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace. It's a political Justice Department.And Jim you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies. We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders. We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.And to expand on Mr. Carson's or Dr. Carson's question let's face it we have laws already. We don't need newer (ph) laws. We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for again does anybody out there think that giving Washington D.C. the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea given how well they have done running the government?So what we do though is if there is somebody who is price- gouging we have laws for prosecutors to take that on. Let's let a Justice Department and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word. It will be a way of life.
2015-10-28 00:00:00,carson, Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it. I do however believe in Reagan's 11th commandment and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here. And recognizing that it's so important this election because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government. Well first of all I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent. I used the tithing analogy. The rate the rate the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent. You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes. You also have to some strategically cutting in several places. Remember we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies. Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.So also we can stimulate the economy. That's gonna be the real growth engine. Stimulating the economy because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations... That's not true. When when we put all the facts down you'll be able to see that it's not true it works out very well. Since I was attacked too. Let me just say if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. You're talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion. But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things including corporate taxes and including the capital gains taxes you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky. Well there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits and they don't take into consideration the American people. What we have to start thinking about as leaders particularly in government is what can we do for the average American? And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market. Well the average small manufacturer whatever they're manufacturing drugs or anything if they have less than 50 employees the average cost in terms of regulations is $34000 per employee. Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.So what we're going to have to start doing instead of you know picking on this group or this group is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives and that is what is causing the problem.

2015-10-28 00:00:00,fiorina," Well gee after the last debate I was told that I didn't smile enough. But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt. I agree with them. And this big powerful corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big the powerful the wealthy and the well-connected. Meantime wages have stagnated for 40 years. We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years. Ours was intended to be a citizen government. This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back. Let me just say on taxes how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington D.C.? We have been talking about it for decades. We now have a 73000-page tax code. There have been more than 4000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone. There are loads of great ideas great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.The problem is we never get it done. We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades. It never happens. And the politicians always say it is so complicated nobody but a politician can figure it out.The truth is this the big problem we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done not to talk about it not to propose it to get it done. That's right three pages. You know why three? No. You know why three? Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big the powerful the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and yes lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73000 pages. Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody. Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.So yes you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform the issue is who is going to get it done. You know the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent 80 percent and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover. I was recruited to H.P. to save a company. It was a company that had grown into a bloated inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders. It had missed before I had arrived expectations for nine quarters in a row.As an outsider I tackled H.P.'s entrenched problems head-on. I cut the bureaucracy down to size re-introduced accountability focused on service on innovation on leading in every market in every product segment.And yes it was a very difficult time. However we saved 80000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160000 jobs and scores of technology companies literally went out of business like Gateway taking all their jobs with them.The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times. I think actually people are looking for that in Washington now. And yes I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom. There are politics in the boardroom as well.And yet the man who led my firing Tom Perkins an icon of Silicon Valley has come out publicly and said ""you know what? We were wrong. She was right. She was a great CEO. She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P. is exactly the leadership we need in Washington D.C. Well this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom Becky. Nevertheless one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.So you know I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail. I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way I was held criminally liable. Imagine imagine if a politician were held to that standard of account.I will run on my record all day long. And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up... ...and be held accountable. You know I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about. Crony capitalism is alive and well and has been so in Washington D.C. for decades. What's crony capitalism? Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating? Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street? Because when government gets big and powerful the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power and meanwhile the small and the powerless in this case 1590 community banks go out of business.You see folks this is how socialism starts. Government causes a problem and then government steps in to solve the problem. This is why fundamentally we have to take our government back.The student loan problem has been created by government. Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem. The FCC jumping in now and saying ""we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet"" is going to create massive problems.But guess who pushed for that regulation? The big Internet companies. This is what's going on. Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid. It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together. It's you see the health insurance companies getting together. It's why you see the banks consolidating.And meanwhile small businesses are getting crushed. Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed. Community banks are going out of business. Big government favors the big the powerful the wealthy and the well-connected and crushes the small and the powerless. It is why we have to simplify. It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government. It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless. Becky it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President when every single policy she espouses and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women. 92 percent 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women. Senator Cruz is precisely right. Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration. The number of women living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record. I am a conservative because I know our values our principles and our policies work better to lift everyone up men and women. Well gee after the last debate I was told that I didn't smile enough. But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt. I agree with them.

2015-10-28 00:00:00,bush, You know I am by my nature impatient. And this is not an endeavor that rewards that. You gotta be patient. You gotta be stick with it and all that. But also I can't fake anger. I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth. And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country. It's never been that way in American politics before.I can't do it. I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply you know going down. I think we're on the verge of the greatest time and I want to fix the things to let people rise up. Could I could I bring something up here because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service which means that he shows up to work. He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field. He's a gifted politician. But Marco when you signed up for this this was a six-year term and you should be showing up to work. I mean literally the Senate what is it like a French work week? You get like three days where you have to show up? You can campaign or just resign and let someone else take the job. There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day. He wasn't my senator. Well I've been No no. What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington D.C. now. Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington D.C. But if you want someone who has a proven effective leadership that was a governor of a state that transformed the culture there elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington D.C.  the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future. They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future. They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back. There are lids on people's aspirations. Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time. Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president and the left just wants more of the same. We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy which I've laid out.And you can go get it at jeb2016.com. Well the deal was done. Barack Obama got his massive tax increase and there was no spending cuts. You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday more spending more tax increasing more regulation. And now we have to accept 2 percent the new normal for economic growth. And the net result is the middle class has $2300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president. And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.We need to reverse that. And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year. You don't have to guess about it because I actually have a record. $19 billion of tax cuts 1.3 million jobs created. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income. You find me... You find me a Democrat you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars? Heck find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars. I'll talk to them. Look the the deal is already done. The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama and spending's gone up. You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes cutting spending ten dollars I'll give them a warm kiss. You know I am by my nature impatient. And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.

2015-10-28 00:00:00,cruz," I'm too agreeable easy going. You know I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite. I'm a fighter. I am passionate about what I believe. I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution. And you know for six-and-a-half years we've had a gigantic party. If you want someone to grab a beer with I may not be that guy. But if you want someone to drive you home I will get the job done and I will get you home. Becky if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up I rolled out my tax plan today you can find it on line at tedcruz.org. It is a simple flat tax where for individuals a family of four pays nothing on the first $36000. After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up. The billionaire and the working man no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.On top of that there is a business flat tax of 16 percent. Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes and as small business.And you wanted to know the numbers the Tax Foundation which has scored every one of our plans shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs to raise wages over 12 percent and to generate 14 percent growth.And it costs with dynamic scoring less than a trillion dollars. Those are the hard numbers. And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income. Growth is the answer. And as Reagan demonstrated if we cut taxes we can bring back growth. You know let me say something at the outset. The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media. This is not a cage match. And you look at the questions ""Donald Trump are you a comic-book villain?"" ""Ben Carson can you do math?"" ""John Kasich will you insult two people over here?"" ""Marco Rubio why don't you resign?"" ""Jeb Bush why have your numbers fallen?"" How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about? And Carl Carl I'm not finished yet. The contrast with the Democratic debate where every fawning question from the media was ""Which of you is more handsome and why?"" And let me be clear. Let me be clear. The men and women on this stage have more ideas more experience more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary. The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other. It should be what are your substantive positions... You want me to answer that question? I'm happy to answer the question... Let me tell you how that question... Let me tell you how that question... ... so you don't actually want to hear the answer John? You don't want to hear the answer. You just want to... You're not interested in an answer. ...Then I'll buy you a tequila... ...Or even some famous Colorado brownies. Well sure. This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken. Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems. And let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange and I want to say I think both Chris and Mike are right. Governor Huckabee's exactly right we need to honor the promises made to our seniors but for younger workers look. I'm 44 years old.It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us. We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own we control them we can pass on to our kids. Well we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling. The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.You know you look at women working. I'll tell you in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family. My sister was a single mom both of my aunts who were a single moms. My mom who's here today was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.Now thank God my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together. But I the struggle of single moms is extraordinary. And you know when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama 3.7 million women have entered poverty.Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy the median wage for women has dropped $733. The the truth of the matter is big government benefits the wealthy it benefits the lobbyists it benefits the giant corporations. And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses it's single moms it's Hispanics. That is who I'm fighting for. The people that Washington leaves behind. I'm too agreeable easy going. You know I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite. I'm a fighter. I am passionate about what I believe. I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution. And you know for six-and-a-half years we've had a gigantic party. If you want someone to grab a beer with I may not be that guy.

Those are the hard numbers. And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income. Growth is the answer. And as Reagan demonstrated if we cut taxes we can bring back growth. You know let me say something at the outset. The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media. This is not a cage match. And you look at the questions ""Donald Trump are you a comic-book villain?"" ""Ben Carson can you do math?"" ""John Kasich will you insult two people over here?"" ""Marco Rubio why don't you resign?"" ""Jeb Bush why have your numbers fallen?"" How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about? And Carl Carl I'm not finished yet. The contrast with the Democratic debate where every fawning question from the media was ""Which of you is more handsome and why?"" And let me be clear. Let me be clear. The men and women on this stage have more ideas more experience more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary. The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other. It should be what are your substantive positions... You want me to answer that question? I'm happy to answer the question... Let me tell you how that question... Let me tell you how that question... ... so you don't actually want to hear the answer John? You don't want to hear the answer. You just want to... You're not interested in an answer. ...Then I'll buy you a tequila... ...Or even some famous Colorado brownies. Well sure. This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken. Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems. And let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange and I want to say I think both Chris and Mike are right. Governor Huckabee's exactly right we need to honor the promises made to our seniors but for younger workers look. I'm 44 years old.It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us. We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own we control them we can pass on to our kids. Well we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling. The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.You know you look at women working. I'll tell you in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family. My sister was a single mom both of my aunts who were a single moms. My mom who's here today was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.Now thank God my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together. But I the struggle of single moms is extraordinary. And you know when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama 3.7 million women have entered poverty.Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy the median wage for women has dropped $733. The the truth of the matter is big government benefits the wealthy it benefits the lobbyists it benefits the giant corporations. And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses it's single moms it's Hispanics. That is who I'm fighting for. The people that Washington leaves behind."
2015-10-28 00:00:00,kasich, Good question but I want to tell you my great concern is that we are on the verge perhaps of picking someone who cannot do this job. I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out out in the in the cold. I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 people here from this country out of this country splitting families. I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up that put our kids in in a deeper hole than they are today.We need somebody who can lead. We need somebody who can balance budgets cut taxes... You know frankly I did it in Washington in Ohio and I will do it again in Washington if I'm president to get this country moving again. country moving again. Listen I want to just comment. Well I want to comment on this. This is the fantasy... This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning. I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget. You can't do it with empty promised. You know these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.I actually have a plan. I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs cut taxes balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic. You just don't make promises like this.Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot while we're you know coming up coming up with these fantasy tax schemes. We'll just clean it up. Where are you gonna clean it up?You have to deal with entitlements you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending. You gotta be creative and imaginative.Now let me just be clear John. I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus. We're up 347000 jobs.When I was in Washington I fought to get the budget balanced. I was the architect. It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon. We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.That's was hard work. Fiscal discipline know what you're doing. Creativity.This stuff is fantasy. Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid. Come on that's just not you scare senior citizens with that. It's not responsible. Well I mean right here. To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government? And we're going to just fix everything with waste fraud and abuse? Or that we're just going to be great? Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans or 10 million people out of this country leaving their children here in this country and dividing families? Folks we've got to wake up. We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job. You have got to pick somebody who has experience somebody that has the know-how the discipline.And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets growing jobs the same in Ohio. And I will go back to Washington with my plan. And I will have done it within 100 days and it will pass. And we will be strong again. Thank you. Let me just let me respond. First of all Ohio does have an energy industry but we're diversified. We're one of the fastest growing states in the country. We came back from the dead. And you know what? It works very very well. And secondly when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers. I was a banker and I was proud of it. And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work. My state is doing great across the board. And guess what in 2011 I got a deal... ... an agreement with the... ... that he tried to take credit for four years later. It's a joke. John Harwood there's a bigger issue here. Well first of all when we talk about the Import Export Bank it's time to clean up corporate welfare. If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people we ought to reform it for rich people as well. Secondly in our state we went from a loss of 350000 jobs to now a gain of 347000 jobs to the positive. Our wages are growing faster than the national average and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state $5 billion including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax. I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier this budget deal in Washington.This is the same old stuff since I left.You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.I don't know if people understand but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget. We actually did it. And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.Reforming entitlements cutting taxes. You see because if you really want to get to a balanced budget you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy. So what I will tell you about our incentives our incentives are tight and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.And you know what? Ohio one of the best growing places in the country I not only did it in Washington I did it in Ohio and I'll go back to Washington and there will be no more silly deals... ... If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job. Good question but I want to tell you my great concern is that we are on the verge perhaps of picking someone who cannot do this job. I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out out in the in the cold.

2015-10-28 00:00:00,quick," Gentlemen we'll we'll get back to this just a minute just a minute we're gonna continue this. I wanna talk taxes... Dr. Carson let's talk about taxes. You have a flat tax plan of 10 percent flat taxes and I've looked at it and this is something that is very appealing to a lot of voters but I've had a really tough time trying to make the math work on this.If you were to took a 10 percent tax with the numbers right now in total personal income you're gonna come in with bring in $1.5 trillion. That is less than half of what we bring in right now. And by the way it's gonna leave us in a $2 trillion hole.So what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work? I I understand that but if you if you look at the numbers you probably have to get to 28. 15 percent still leaves you with a $1.1 trillion hole. You'd have to cut you'd have to cut government about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole. That is true I looked at the numbers. Dr. Carson thank you. Governor... Dr. Carson let me get 30 seconds with Dr. Carson... Thank you. Senator Senator thank you. Gentlemen I'm sorry we need to... We're going to move on. Thirty seconds. We'll get to everyone. Ms. Fiorina I I'd like to ask you a question. You are running for president of the United States because of your record running Hewlett-Packard. But the stock market is usually a fair indicator of the performance of a CEO and the market was not kind to you.Someone who invested a dollar in your company the day you took office had lost half of the dollar by the day you left. Obviously you've talked in the past about what a difficult time it was for technology companies but anybody who was following the market knows that your stock was a much worse performer if you looked at your competitors if you looked at the overall market.I just wonder in terms of all of that you know we look back your board fired you. I just wondered why you think we should hire you now. Mrs. Fiorina it's interesting that you bring up Mr. Perkins because... ...he said a lot of very questionable things. Last year in an interview he said that he thinks wealthy people should get more votes than poor people. I think his quote was that ""if you pay zero dollars in taxes you should get zero votes. If you pay a million dollars you should get a million votes."" Is this the type of person you want defending you? Mrs. Fiorina. Thank you we're out of time. Thank you Mrs. Fiorina. Carl. Governor Christie I'd like to a question next. Actually I have a question for you . In your tell it like it is campaign you've said a lot of tough things. You've said that we need to raise the retirement age for Social Security. You think that we need to cut benefits for people who make over $80000 and eliminate them entirely for seniors who are making over $200000.Governor Huckabee who is here on the stage has said that you and others who think this way are trying to rob seniors of the benefits that they've earned. It raises the question: When it is acceptable to break a social compact? ...Governor... ...Thank you. Welcome back to the presidential debate for the Republicans. We are live in Boulder Colorado right here on CNBC. Folks we'll get right back into this.Mr. Trump let's talk a little bit about bankruptcies. Your Atlantic City casinos filed for bankruptcy four times. In fact Fitch the ratings agency even said that they were serial filers for all of this. You said that you did great with Atlantic City and you did. But some of the individuals the bondholders some of the contractors who worked for you didn't fare so well.Bankruptcy is a broken promise. Why should the voters believe the promises that you're telling them right now? Mr. Trump thank you. Senator Rubio you yourself have said that you've had issues. You have a lack of bookkeeping skills. You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money. You faced (ph) foreclosure on a second home that you bought. And just last year you liquidated a $68000 retirement fund. That's something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties. In terms of all of that it raises the question whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy. What do you say? Senator I understand all of that. I had a lot of student loans when I got out too. But you've had a windfall that a lot of Americans haven't. You made over a million dollars on a book deal and some of these problems came after that. But you but you liquidated that retirement account after the fact and that cost you about $24000 out of that in taxes and feed. That that was after you'd already come into that windfall. That's why I raised the question. Yes thank you John. Senator Cruz working women in this country still earn just 77 percent of what men earn. And I know that you've said you've been very sympathetic to our cause. But you've also you said that the Democrats' moves to try and change this are the political show votes.I just wonder what you would do as President to try and help in this cause? Mrs. Fiorina Mrs. Fiorina we will come back to you. Thank you Mrs. Fiorina. Carl? Gentlemen we'll we'll get back to this just a minute just a minute we're gonna continue this. I wanna talk taxes...

2015-10-28 00:00:00,harwood, Mr. Trump you've done very well in this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it. Send 11 million people out of the country. Cut taxes $10 trillion without increasing the deficit. And make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others. Let's be honest. Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign? We're at the 60 seconds. We're at 60 seconds but I gotta ask you you talked about your tax plan. You say that it would not increase the deficit because you cut taxes $10 trillion in the economy would take off like... Hold on hold on. The economy would take off like a rocket ship. I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties. They said that you have as chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms. The Tax Foundation says has looked at all of our plans and and his creates even with the dynamic effect $8 trillion dollar deficit... Governor Kasich hold it I'm coming to you right now. The... Well I'm asking you about this. I'm about to ask you about this. That is you had some very strong words to say yesterday about what's happening in your party and what you're hearing from the two gentlemen we've just heard from. Would you repeat it? Well let's just get more pointed about it. You said yesterday that you were hearing proposals that were just crazy from your colleagues. Who were you talking about? Hold on. I think there's a I've got question for Hold on Governor. I've got a question for Governor Bush. No we're moving to Governor Bush. Governor the fact that you're at the fifth lectern tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race despite the big investment your donors have made. You noted recently after slashing your payroll that you had better things to do than sit around and be demonized by other people. I wanted to ask you OK. Got it. But it's a OK. It's a it's a question about why you're having difficulty. I want to ask you in this context. Ben Bernanke who was appointed Fed chairman by your brother recently wrote a book in which he said he no longer considers himself a Republican because the Republican Party has given in to know- nothingism. Is that why you're having a difficult time in this race? Thank you Governor. We're gonna get down the line. Becky's got a question. Senator Paul I've got a question for you on the same subject. Senator Paul? You used your time on something else. Senator Paul? Senator Paul the budget deal crafted by Speaker Boehner and passed by the House today makes cuts in entitlement programs Medicare and Social Security disability which are the very programs conservatives say need cutting to shrink government and solve our country's long-term budget deficit. Do you oppose that budget deal because it doesn't cut those programs enough? Senator if what you just said is true why did Speaker Boehner craft this deal and why did Paul Ryan who has a strong reputation for fiscal discipline vote for it? Thank you Senator . Jim thanks. Governor Bush in a debate like this four years ago every Republican running for president pledged to oppose a budget deal containing any tax increase even if it had spending cuts ten times as large.A few months later you told Congress put me in coach you said you would take that deal. Still feel that way? But to to the point that you made to Congress if you were president and you were offered a bipartisan deal that had one dollar... ...one dollar of tax increases per ten dollars of spending cuts would you take it? So you don't want the coach to put you in any more? Thank you governor. Carl? Governor John Kasich you've called for abolishing the Export Import Bank which provides subsidies to help American companies compete with overseas competitors. You call that corporate welfare. One of the largest newspapers in your state wrote an editorial said they found that strange writing that if that's corporate welfare what does Kasich call the millions of dollars in financial incentives doled out to attract or retain jobs by his development effort jobs Ohio.If subsidies are good enough for Ohio companies why aren't they good enough for companies trying to compete overseas? Thank you Governor. Thank you Governor. Thank you. Mr. Trump you've done very well in this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it.

2015-10-28 00:00:00,paul, You know I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt. We borrow a million dollars a minute. Now on the floor of the Congress the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit. It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money. I will stand firm. I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it. I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it. And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt. No I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items. That's what they're doing. They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending. Here's the thing. When you look at raising the debt limit it should be leverage to try to reform government. In 2011 the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government. Instead the Washington establishment raised both. We raised the military spending took from entitlements and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this. This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left. Right and left are spending us into oblivion. We should use the debt ceiling as precisely to Don to force upon them budgetary reforms. Well that's a real question. Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership? I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same. People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this. Well you know what I'm worried about? Not keeping the government open. I'm worried about bankrupting the American people. We're borrowing a million dollars a minute. That is important. And that's what we have to contrast. Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute. You know I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt. We borrow a million dollars a minute. Now on the floor of the Congress the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.

2015-09-16 00:00:00,trump," I'm Donald Trump. I wrote ""The Art of the Deal"". I say not in a braggadocious way I've made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world and I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals we make our country rich again we make it great again. We build our military we take care of our vets we get rid of Obamacare and we have a great life altogether. Thank you. Thank you. Well first of all Rand Paul shouldn't even be on this stage. He's number 11 he's got 1 percent in the polls and how he got up here there's far too many people anyway. As far as temperament and we all know that as far as temperament I think I have a great temperament. I built a phenomenal business with incredible iconic assets one of the really truly great real-estate businesses. And I may be an entertainer because I've had tremendous success with number-one bestsellers all over the place with ""The Apprentice"" and everything else I've done. But I will tell you this: What I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman and that's the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back because we owe $19 trillion right now $19 trillion and you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back. And believe me my temperament is very good very calm. But we will be respected outside of this country. We are not respected now. I never attacked him on his look and believe me there's plenty of subject matter right there. That I can tell you. I've actually been in politics all my life although I've been on that side as opposed to this side. I'm now a politician for about three months. Obviously I'm doing pretty well. I'm number one in every poll by a lot. But the qualification is that I've dealt with people all over the world been successful all over the world. Everything I've done virtually has been a tremendous success. When markets changed when things turned I heard Governor Pataki who by the way was a failed governor in New York a very seriously failed he wouldn't be elected dog catcher right now. I heard what he had to say. And I will tell you this: Atlantic City I've made a tremendous amount of money in Atlantic City. I left seven years ago I've gotten great credit for my timing and that's what I'm all about. I'm a businessman did really well really well and Jeb what I want to do is put that ability into this country to make our country rich again. And I can do that and I'm not sure that anybody else in the group will be able to do that. But I have to say... Well in Wisconsin... Excuse me. In Wisconsin you're losing $2.2 billion right now. I would do so much better than that. No. I'm using facts. Every major business leader has used the I never went bankrupt by the way as you know everybody knows. But we hundreds of companies hundreds of deals I've used Every major business leader has used the I never went bank bankrupt by the way as you know everybody knows. But hundreds of companies hundreds of deals I used the law four times and made a tremendous thing. I'm in business. I did a very good job. But I will say this and people are very very impressed with what I've done the business people. But when the folks of Iowa found out the true facts of the job that you've done in Wisconsin all of a sudden you tubed (ph) he was No. 1 and now he's No. 6 or seven in the polls. So look we brought it out you were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state. You lost 2.2 you have right now a huge budget deficit. That's not a Democratic point. That's a point. That's a fact. And when the people of Iowa found that out I went to No. 1 and you went down the tubes. I didn't Totally false. I would have gotten it. I promise I would have gotten it. I promise if I wanted it I would have gotten it. I know my people. I know my people. No. I just will tell you that you know Jeb made the statement. I'm not only referring to him. I a lot of money was raised by a lot of different people that are standing up here. And the donors the special interests the lobbyists have very strong power over these people. I'm spending all of my money I'm not spending I'm not getting any I turned down I turn down so much I could have right now from special interests and donors I could have double and triple what he's got. I've turned it down. I turned down last week $5 million from somebody. So I will tell you I understand the game I've been on the other side all of my life. And they have a lot of control over our politicians. And I don't say that favorably and I'm not sure if there's another system but I say this. I am not accepting any money from anybody. Nobody has control of me other than the people of this country. I'm going to do the right thing. That's true. That's true. I was excuse me Jeb. I was a businessman I got along with Clinton I got along with everybody. That was my job to get along with people. I didn't want to excuse me. One second. OK more energy tonight. I like that. Look I didn't want it was my obligation as a businessman to my family to my company to my employees to get along with all politicians. I get along with all of them and I did a damn good job in doing it. Go ahead. Got along with everybody. Wrong. Don't make things up. Jeb don't make things up. Come on. Don't make things up. So number one they have to respect you. He has absolutely no respect for President Obama. Zero. Syria's a mess. You look at what's going on with ISIS in there now think of this: we're fighting ISIS. ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants. I would talk to him. I would get along with him. I believe and I may be wrong in which case I'd probably have to take a different path but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with. We don't get along with China. We don't get along with the heads of Mexico. We don't get along with anybody and yet at the same time they rip us left and right. They take advantage of us economically and every other way. We get along with nobody. I will get along I think with Putin and I will get along with others and we will have a much more stable stable world. I believe that I will get along we will do between that Ukraine all of the other problems we won't have the kind of problems that our country has right now with Russia and many other nations. I wouldn't have drawn the line but once he drew it he had no choice but to go across. They do bear some responsibility but I think he probably didn't do it not for that reason. Somehow he just doesn't have courage. There is something missing from our president. Had he crossed the line and really gone in with force done something to Assad if he had gone in with tremendous force you wouldn't have millions of people displaced all over the world. They had a responsibility absolutely. I think we have three of them here... I think they had a responsibility yes. Jeb just... I think it will haunt him. I think it's a terrible. I think it's going to haunt him absolutely. He came back later and he said he misspoke. There was no question because I heard when he said the statement. I was watching and he said the statement. And I said wow I can't believe it. I wilvent. Round 2 of CNN's presidential debate starts now. The eleven leading Republican candidates for president are at their podiums. They are ready to face off and if you've been watching this race you know anything could happen over the next few hours. To viewers who are just joining us welcome to the Air Force One Pavilion of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Our thanks to the staff here and especially to former first lady Nancy Reagan for this impressive setting with Ronald Reagan's presidential plane as our backdrop. This debate is airing on CNN networks in the United States and around the world. It's also being broadcast on the Salem Radio Network. I know everyone is very eager to get started. But first I want to explain the ground rules tonight. My name is Jake Tapper. I'll be the moderator. I will be joined in the questioning by Salem Radio Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt. He worked in the Reagan administration for six years. And by CNN's chief political correspondent Dana Bash. I will ask follow-up questions I will attempt to guide the discussion. Candidates I will try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions. You'll have one minute to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. I'll give you time to respond if you've been singled out for criticism. Our viewers should know we have timing lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. These 11 Republicans are positioned on the stage based on their ranking in recent national polls. Our goal for this evening is a debate. A true debate with candidates addressing each other in areas where they differ. Where they disagree on policy on politics on leadership. Now let's begin. I'd like to invite each candidate to take 30 seconds to introduce him or herself to our audience. First to you Senator Paul. I'm Donald Trump. I wrote ""The Art of the Deal"". I say not in a braggadocious way I've made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world and I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals we make our country rich again we make it great again.

A true debate with candidates addressing each other in areas where they differ. Where they disagree on policy on politics on leadership. Now let's begin. I'd like to invite each candidate to take 30 seconds to introduce him or herself to our audience. First to you Senator Paul. Senator Cruz? Thank you one and all for being here. There are many important policy issues facing our nation. We're going to get to many of them tonight but I do want to start off with some current events in the news and also some of the comments the candidates have recently made on the campaign trail. Mrs. Fiorina I want to start with you. Fellow Republican candidate and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has suggested that your party's frontrunner Mr. Donald Trump would be dangerous as President. He said he wouldn't want quote ""such a hot head with his finger on the nuclear codes."" You as well have raised concerns about Mr. Trump's temperament. You've dismissed him as an entertainer. Would you feel comfortable with Donald trump's finger on the nuclear codes? You didn't answer my question. Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear codes? It's an issue that one of your fellow candidates has raised. Mr. Trump? Mr. Senator Paul your name has been invoked. Mr. Trump? I want to I want to give Mr. Trump... ... Mr. Trump I want to give you another chance Mr. Trump I want to give you a chance to respond to something that your rival to your left Governor Bush said. Governor Bush told me last week when I read him the quote from Governor Jindal that he agrees you're not a serious candidate. Tell Governor Bush why you are a serious candidate and what your qualifications are to be commander-in-chief. Governor Bush would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear codes? Governor Walker? Let's move on. A phenomenon going on in the race right now is the political... OK Governor Kasich go ahead. We have a lot of issues coming up sir. We are getting to the issues sir. Phenomenon going on in the race is the political outsiders in the race Dr. Carson Donald Trump Carly Fiorina all together have majority support in the polls. Governor Christie I want to ask you about something that Dr. Carson said the other day. Dr. Carson said campaigning is easier for him because he's not a politician. He can just tell the truth therefore while politicians quote ""Have their finger in the air to see and do what is politically expedient."" Governor Christie tell Dr. Carson is that a fair description of you? Well let's find out. Thank you. Thank you Governor Christie. Dr. Carson who were you thinking about on this stage when you said that? And more broadly is experience in government not important for a president to have? Thank you Dr. Carson. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Ms. Fiorina. Governor Bush in addition to the fact that he's an outsider one of the reasons Mr. Trump is a frontrunner Republican voters say is because they like the fact that he is not bought and paid for by wealthy donors. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the $100 million you've raised for your campaign makes you a puppet for your donors. Are you? Is there anything else you want to say about this? Governor Sure Dr. Carson. Thank you Dr. Carson. Let's move to Russia if we could. Russia is sending troops and tanks into Syria right now to prop up a U.S. enemy Bashar al-Assad. President Obama's incoming top general says quote ""Russia presents the greatest threat to our national security."" Mr. Trump you say you can do business with President Vladimir Putin you say you will get along quote ""very well."" What would you do right now if you were president to get the Russians out of Syria? So you just to clarify the only answer I heard to the question I asked is that you would you would reach out to Vladimir Putin and you would do what? You would... Senator Rubio you've taken a very different approach to the the question of Russia. You've called Vladimir Putin a quote ""gangster."" Why would President Rubio's approach be more effective than President Trump's? Thank you Senator Rubio. I want to bring in Carly Fiorina. Ms. Fiorina you have met... ...yeah you've met Vladimir Putin. Yes. Thank you Ms. Fiorina. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Ms. Fiorina. While you're while you brought up the subject of General Suleimani of the Quds forces from Iran the next president no matter who he or she may be will inherit President Obama's Iran deal. Senator Cruz Governor Kasich says that anyone who is promising to rip up the Iran deal on day one as you have promised to do is quote ""inexperienced"" and quote ""playing to a crowd."" Respond to Governor Kasich please. Why is that not as Governor Kasich says playing to the crowd and an example of you being inexperienced? Governor Kasich... ...Did Senator Cruz just play to the crowd? ...Thank you Governor. I want to go to Senator Paul. I want to go to Senator Paul. Senator Paul the White House is rolling out the red carpet next week for the President of China President Xi. Governor Walker says that President Obama should cancel the state dinner because of China's currency manipulation and because of China's alleged cyber attacks against the United States. Is Governor Walker right? Governor Walker Senator Paul seemed to suggest... ...that canceling the state dinner would be rash and reckless. ...Governor Bush... Governor Bush your father was the chief diplomatic envoy to China back when Nixon opened relations to China. Is Scott Walker's approach the right one canceling the state dinner? I want to turn... ...I want to turn to Governor Huckabee who has been very patient. Somebody had to be 11th and he is but I do want to change the subject to the event that you had... ... however you want but I want to ask this question. All right sir go ahead. OK. ( UNKNOWN ): Jake I'd like to... We're going to turn now to Hugh Hewitt from Salem Radio Network. Thank you Senator Paul. I want to turn now to my colleague Dana Bash. That would be fair you're right. You're the third senator. We're going to go to Dana Bash... Senator Cruz? Thank you Senator. Thank you Senator. Thank you Senator. I want to... ... turn back to Governor Huckabee... I want to turn back to Governor Huckabee. Governor Huckabee last week you held a rally for a county clerk in Kentucky who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples as I don't need to tell you. You've called what happened to Kim Davis that clerk ""an example of the criminalization of Christianity."" There are several people on the stage who disagree with you. Governor Bush for example says that that clerk is sworn to uphold the law. Is Governor Bush on the wrong side of the criminalization of Christianity? Thank you Governor. Well I'm not telling you that Governor. But Governor Bush is because he because he disagrees. He thinks that Kim Davis swore to uphold the law. You disagree? You're not you don't... OK. Please do. You did... Governor you said quote ""she is sworn to uphold the law."" Let me go to my colleague Dana Bash who has a question. Dana I want to continue on the subject. Governor Bush you recently said while discussing Planned Parenthood quote you're ""not sure we need a half billion for women's health issues."" Now you've since said that you misspoke you didn't mean to say ""women's health issues."" But Donald Trump said that quote that comment which Hillary Clinton did seize upon immediately will haunt you the same way Mitt Romney's 47 percent video haunted him. Tell Donald Trump why he's wrong. Thank you Governor Bush. Donald Trump let me just... The quote was ""I'm not sure we need half a billion dollars for women's health issues."" He said he misspoke. You said that that's going to haunt him. Why do you think that? Senator Cruz? Thank you one and all for being here. There are many important policy issues facing our nation. We're going to get to many of them tonight but I do want to start off with some current events in the news and also some of the comments the candidates have recently made on the campaign trail.

Mr. Trump you say you can do business with President Vladimir Putin you say you will get along quote ""very well."" What would you do right now if you were president to get the Russians out of Syria? So you just to clarify the only answer I heard to the question I asked is that you would you would reach out to Vladimir Putin and you would do what? You would... Senator Rubio you've taken a very different approach to the the question of Russia. You've called Vladimir Putin a quote ""gangster."" Why would President Rubio's approach be more effective than President Trump's? Thank you Senator Rubio. I want to bring in Carly Fiorina. Ms. Fiorina you have met... ...yeah you've met Vladimir Putin. Yes. Thank you Ms. Fiorina. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Ms. Fiorina. While you're while you brought up the subject of General Suleimani of the Quds forces from Iran the next president no matter who he or she may be will inherit President Obama's Iran deal. Senator Cruz Governor Kasich says that anyone who is promising to rip up the Iran deal on day one as you have promised to do is quote ""inexperienced"" and quote ""playing to a crowd."" Respond to Governor Kasich please. Why is that not as Governor Kasich says playing to the crowd and an example of you being inexperienced? Governor Kasich... ...Did Senator Cruz just play to the crowd? ...Thank you Governor. I want to go to Senator Paul. I want to go to Senator Paul. Senator Paul the White House is rolling out the red carpet next week for the President of China President Xi. Governor Walker says that President Obama should cancel the state dinner because of China's currency manipulation and because of China's alleged cyber attacks against the United States. Is Governor Walker right? Governor Walker Senator Paul seemed to suggest... ...that canceling the state dinner would be rash and reckless. ...Governor Bush... Governor Bush your father was the chief diplomatic envoy to China back when Nixon opened relations to China. Is Scott Walker's approach the right one canceling the state dinner? I want to turn... ...I want to turn to Governor Huckabee who has been very patient. Somebody had to be 11th and he is but I do want to change the subject to the event that you had... ... however you want but I want to ask this question. All right sir go ahead. OK. ( UNKNOWN ): Jake I'd like to... We're going to turn now to Hugh Hewitt from Salem Radio Network. Thank you Senator Paul. I want to turn now to my colleague Dana Bash. That would be fair you're right. You're the third senator. We're going to go to Dana Bash... Senator Cruz? Thank you Senator. Thank you Senator. Thank you Senator. I want to... ... turn back to Governor Huckabee... I want to turn back to Governor Huckabee. Governor Huckabee last week you held a rally for a county clerk in Kentucky who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples as I don't need to tell you. You've called what happened to Kim Davis that clerk ""an example of the criminalization of Christianity."" There are several people on the stage who disagree with you. Governor Bush for example says that that clerk is sworn to uphold the law. Is Governor Bush on the wrong side of the criminalization of Christianity? Thank you Governor. Well I'm not telling you that Governor. But Governor Bush is because he because he disagrees. He thinks that Kim Davis swore to uphold the law. You disagree? You're not you don't... OK. Please do. You did... Governor you said quote ""she is sworn to uphold the law."" Let me go to my colleague Dana Bash who has a question. Dana I want to continue on the subject. Governor Bush you recently said while discussing Planned Parenthood quote you're ""not sure we need a half billion for women's health issues."" Now you've since said that you misspoke you didn't mean to say ""women's health issues."" But Donald Trump said that quote that comment which Hillary Clinton did seize upon immediately will haunt you the same way Mitt Romney's 47 percent video haunted him. Tell Donald Trump why he's wrong. Thank you Governor Bush. Donald Trump let me just... The quote was ""I'm not sure we need half a billion dollars for women's health issues."" He said he misspoke. You said that that's going to haunt him. Why do you think that?"
2015-09-16 00:00:00,<b>hewitt, Thank you Jake. Mr. Trump two years ago President Obama drew a red line that the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad crossed President Obama threatened to strike. He did not his knees buckled. We now have 4 million refugees Syria is a living hell and he turned to the Congress for the authority to back him up. You have three senators to your right that said no. Do they bear responsibility for this refugee crisis and what would you have done when Bashar Assad crossed the line? Thank you Jake.

2015-09-16 00:00:00,cruz," I'm Ted Cruz. I am the son of an Irish-Italian mom and a Cuban immigrant dad who fled oppression and came to America seeking freedom. I'm a husband to my best friend Heidi who's here tonight. I'm a dad to two little girls who are the loves of my life Caroline and Catherine. If you're fed up with Washington if you're looking for someone to stand up to career politicians in both parties I'm the only one on this stage who has done that over and over again and if we stand together we can bring America back. Well let me tell you Jake the single biggest national security threat facing America right now is the threat of a nuclear Iran. We've seen six and a half years of President Obama leading from behind. Weakness is provocative and this Iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic. This deal on its face will send over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei making the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism. This deal abandons four American hostages in Iran and this deal will only accelerate Iran's acquiring nuclear weapons. You'd better believe it. If I am elected president on the very first day in office I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. Well let's be clear when it comes to experience. What President Obama wants to do is he's run to the United Nations and he wants to use the United Nations to bind the United States and take away our sovereignty. Well I spent five and a half years as a Solicitor General of Texas the lead lawyer for the state in front of the U.S. Supreme Court and I went in front of the Supreme Court and took on the world court of the United Nations in a case called Medellin v. Texas and we won a historic victory saying the World Court and the U.N. has no power to bind the United States and no President of the United States Republican or Democrat has the authority to give away our sovereignty. And so if there's anyone up here who would be bound by this catastrophic deal with Iran they're giving up the core responsibility of commander in chief and as president I would never do that. Jake Jake... Jake there is no more important topic in 2016 than this topic right here and I've listened to several folks saying ""Well gosh if they cheat we'll act."" We won't know under this agreement there are several facilities in Iran they designate as military facilities that are off limit all together. Beyond that the other facilities we give them 24 days notice before inspecting them. That is designed to allow them to hide the evidence. And most astonishingly this agreement trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves. That makes no sense whatsoever. And let me know President Obama is violating federal law... ... by not handing over the side deals and we ought to see the United States Congress... ... stand up together and say ""Hand over this treaty and protect this country."" Well let me tell you Dana number one I'm proud to stand for life. These Planned Parenthood videos are horrifying. I would encourage every American to watch the videos. See seeing your Planned Parenthood officials callously heartlessly bartering and selling the body parts of human beings and then ask yourself ""are these my values?"" These are horrifying. On these videos Planned Parenthood also essentially confesses to multiple felonies. It is a felony with ten years' jail term to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit. That's what these videos show Planned Parenthood doing. Absolutely we shouldn't be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise and I'll tell you the fact that Republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama and saying ""we'll give in because Obama threatens a veto."" You know Obama's committed to his principles. His liberal principles he will fight for them. He says... I will veto any budget that doesn't fund Planned Parenthood and Republicans surrender. We need to stop surrendering and start standing... ...for our principles. I'm Ted Cruz.

2015-09-16 00:00:00,rubio," Thank you. My name is Marco Rubio. I'm from Florida. My wife Jeanette and I are the proud we've been married 17 years and we're the proud parents of four children two of whom were able to join us here this evening. I'm honored to be here at the Reagan Library at a place that honors the legacy of a man who inspired not just my interest in public service but also our love for country. And I'm also aware that California has a drought and so that's why I made sure I brought my own water. Well first of all I have an understanding of exactly what it is Russia and Putin are doing and it's pretty straightforward. He wants to reposition Russia once again as a geopolitical force. He himself said that the destruction of the Soviet Union the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century and now he's trying to reverse that. He's trying to destroy NATO. And this is what this is a part of. He is exploiting a vacuum that this administration has left in the Middle East. Here's what you're gonna see in the next few weeks: the Russians will begin to fly fly combat missions in that region not just targeting ISIS but in order to prop up Assad. He will also then turn to other countries in the region and say ""America is no longer a reliable ally Egypt. America is no longer a reliable ally Saudi Arabia. Begin to rely on us."" What he is doing is he is trying to replace us as the single most important power broker in the Middle East and this president is allowing it. That is what is happening in the Middle East. That's what's happening with Russia and... Let me tell you I will tell you we have zero responsibility because let's remember what the president said. He said the attack he would conduct would be a pinprick. Well the United States military was not build to conduct pinprick attacks. If the United States military is going to be engaged by a commander-in-chief it should only be engaged in an endeavor to win. And we're not going to authorize use of force if you're not put in a position where they can win. And quite frankly people don't trust this president as commander-in-chief because of that. Hold on a second Jake he asked me as well. I'd like to actually... ... respond. I think I'm the first senator. The No. 1 test for use of military force should be the vital national security interest of the United States. The reason why I opposed President Obama bombing Syria is because he couldn't answer the question what do you do if chemical weapons end up in the hands of radical Islamic terrorists like al-Nusra like Al Qaida like ISIS? Now I also want to respond to several folks up here who said we should trust this Iranian deal see if the Iranians will comply. Anyone who is paying attention to what Khamenei says knows that they will not comply. There is a reason Khamenei refers to Israel as the little Satan and America as the great Satan. In the middle of negotiating this treaty Khamenei led the assembled masses in chanting death to America. I'm reminded of a great editorial cartoon. It shows the Ayatollah Khamenei saying ""Death to all Americans"" and then it shows John Kerry coming back saying ""Can we meet ya half way?"" We need a commander-in-chief who will stand up and protect this country. And I'll tell you I can't wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton and to make abundantly clear if you vote for Hillary you are voting for the Ayatollah Khomeini to possess a nuclear weapon and if you elect me as president under no circumstances will a theocratic ayatollah who chants death to America ever be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.

2015-09-16 00:00:00,christie, Hi my name is Chris Christie and I'd like to you take the camera off me and put it on the audience because I'd like to ask all of you how many of you raise your hand believe that in today's Barak Obama America your children will have a better life than you've had? You see? That's why I'm running for President. because leadership is not about me it's about our country. And what we talk about tonight it's not about us it's about the people in the audience tonight because in seven short years this president has stripped away their trust and their faith and their belief that the next generation will have a better life. He's stolen that from us and when I'm president I'm going to take it back. Well I know Ben wasn't talking about me I'm sure he was talking about one of the other guys not me. As far as being an outsider is concerned as far as being an outsider is concerned let me tell you this Jake I'm a Republican in New Jersey. I wake up every morning as an outsider. I wake up every morning with a Democratic legislature who trying to beat my head in and fight me because I'm trying to bring conservative change to a state that needed it desperately. And so everyone can talk us here about their credentials. But the bottom line is every morning I get up I veto 400 bills from a crazy liberal Democratic legislature not one of them has been overridden. I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history according to Americans for Tax Reform. What folks want in this country is somebody to go down there and get the job done. And that's exactly what I'll do. So I know this much that what the American people want to hire right now is somebody who believes in them. And believes that they are the ones who can fix our country. I will be the vessel through which they can fix this country but it's not about me. It's about all of you. And getting this government off your back and out of your way and letting you succeed. I know Ben wasn't talking about me. Look at him smiling at me right now. I know Ben didn't mean it about me. One of these other guys I'm sure. Be honest Ben be honest. See Jake it wasn't me. I was She is and so if she based on conscience can't sign that that marriage license then there should be someone in her office to be able to do it and if the law needs to be changed in the state of Kentucky which is what she's advocating it should be changed. And why don't we do the same thing with Planned Parenthood? We elected a Republican Congress to do this. And they should be doing it and they're not. And they're giving the president a pass. I put it in the list Dana. We should be doing these things and forcing the president to take action. Let's force him to do what he says he's going to do. Now I don't know whether he'll do it or not but let's force him to do it.

2015-09-16 00:00:00,carson, Hi I'm Ben Carson and I'm a retired pediatric neurosurgeon. I'm here with my wife Candy of 40 years and two of my sons and their wives. I stress the pediatric part of my career because the reason that I've gotten involved in this race is because I'm very concerned about the future of our children and the direction of our country is one that does not portend well unless we the people intervene and retake our rightful place at the pinnacle. Typically politicians do things that are politically expedient. And they are looking for whatever their particular goal is. That is not the reason that I have gotten into this thing. I'm extraordinary concerned about the direction of this country the divisiveness that is going on fiscal irresponsibility the failure to take a leadership position in the world. All of those things will lead to a situation where the next generation will not have a chance that we've had now. So I don't I don't want to really get into describing who's a politician and who's not a politician but I think the people have kind of made that decision for themselves already and will continue to do so as time goes on. Jake can I say something about that? You know when I entered this race all the political pundits said it's impossible; you can't do it because you're not connected with the money. And there's no way that you can raise what you need in order to compete successfully. I in no way am willing to get in the bed with special interest group or lick the boots of billionaires. I have said to the people if they want me to do this please get involved. And we now have over 500000 donations and the money is coming in. But the pundits forgot about one thing and that is the people. And they are really in charge. Hi I'm Ben Carson and I'm a retired pediatric neurosurgeon.

2015-09-16 00:00:00,fiorina, Good evening. My story from secretary to CEO is only possible in this nation and proves that everyone of us has potential. My husband Frank of 30 years started out driving a tow truck for a family owned auto body shop. We have come to a pivotal point in our nation's history where this nation's possibilities and potential are being crushed by a government grown so big so powerful so inept so corrupt and a political class that refuses to do anything about it. I am prepared to lead the resurgence of this great nation. You know I think Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer. He's been terrific at that business. I also think that one of the benefits of a presidential campaign is the character and capability judgment and temperament of every single one of us is revealed over time and under pressure. All of us will be revealed over time and under pressure. I look forward to a long race. That's not for me to answer; it is for the voters of this country to answer and I have a lot of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the voters of the United States of America. Jake I'll tell you I'll tell you why people are supporting outsiders. It's because you know what happens if someone's been in the system their whole life they don't know how broken the system is. A fish swims in water it doesn't know it's water. It's not that politicians are bad people it's that they've been in that system forever. The truth is 75 percent of the American people think the government is corrupt; 82 percent of the American people think these problems that have festered for 50 years in some cases 25 years in other cases. The border's been insecure for 25 years; 307000 veterans have died waiting for health care. These things have gone on for so long because no one will challenge the status quo. You know what a leader does? They challenge the status quo they solve problems that have festered for a long time and they produce results. That is what my whole life has been about. People know this is about far more than replacing a D with an R this is about changing the system. Having... Having met Vladimir Putin if I may... Having met Vladimir Putin I wouldn't talk to him at all. We've talked way too much to him. What I would do immediately is begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet I would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in Poland I would conduct regular aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states. I'd probably send a few thousand more troops into Germany. Vladimir Putin would get the message. By the way the reason it is so critically important that every one of us know General Suleimani's name is because Russia is in Syria right now because the head of the Quds force traveled to Russia and talked Vladimir Putin into aligning themselves with Iran and Syria to prop up Bashar al- Assad. Russia is a bad actor but Vladimir Putin is someone we should not talk to because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side and we have all of that within our control. We could rebuild the Sixth Fleet. I will. We haven't. We could rebuild the missile defense program. We haven't. I will. We could also to Senator Rubio's point give the Egyptians what they've asked for which is intelligence. We could give the Jordanians what they've asked for... ...bombs and materiel. We have not supplied it... ...I will. We could arm the Kurds. They've been asking us for three years. All of this is within our control. ...Jake... ...Jake ... And then it'll be my turn. Jake? Jake? Dana I'd like to... Dana I would like to link these two issues both of which are incredibly important Iran and Planned Parenthood. One has something to do with the defense of the security of this nation. The other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation. You have not heard a plan about Iran from any politician up here here is my plan. On day one in the Oval Office I will make two phone calls the first to my good friend to Bibi Netanyahu to reassure him we will stand with the state of Israel. The second to the supreme leader to tell him that unless and until he opens every military and every nuclear facility to real anytime anywhere inspections by our people not his we the United States of America will make it as difficult as possible and move money around the global financial system. We can do that we don't need anyone's cooperation to do it. And every ally and every adversary we have in this world will know that the United States in America is back in the leadership business which is how we must stand with our allies. As regards Planned Parenthood anyone who has watched this videotape I dare Hillary Clinton Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table it's heart beating it's legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. This is about the character of our nation and if we will not stand up in and force President Obama to veto this bill shame on us. Good evening. My story from secretary to CEO is only possible in this nation and proves that everyone of us has potential. My husband Frank of 30 years started out driving a tow truck for a family owned auto body shop. We have come to a pivotal point in our nation's history where this nation's possibilities and potential are being crushed by a government grown so big so powerful so inept so corrupt and a political class that refuses to do anything about it. I am prepared to lead the resurgence of this great nation. You know I think Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer. He's been terrific at that business. I also think that one of the benefits of a presidential campaign is the character and capability judgment and temperament of every single one of us is revealed over time and under pressure. All of us will be revealed over time and under pressure. I look forward to a long race. That's not for me to answer; it is for the voters of this country to answer and I have a lot of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the voters of the United States of America. Jake I'll tell you I'll tell you why people are supporting outsiders. It's because you know what happens if someone's been in the system their whole life they don't know how broken the system is. A fish swims in water it doesn't know it's water. It's not that politicians are bad people it's that they've been in that system forever. The truth is 75 percent of the American people think the government is corrupt; 82 percent of the American people think these problems that have festered for 50 years in some cases 25 years in other cases. The border's been insecure for 25 years; 307000 veterans have died waiting for health care. These things have gone on for so long because no one will challenge the status quo. You know what a leader does? They challenge the status quo they solve problems that have festered for a long time and they produce results. That is what my whole life has been about. People know this is about far more than replacing a D with an R this is about changing the system. Having... Having met Vladimir Putin if I may... Having met Vladimir Putin I wouldn't talk to him at all. We've talked way too much to him. What I would do immediately is begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet I would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in Poland I would conduct regular aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states. I'd probably send a few thousand more troops into Germany. Vladimir Putin would get the message. By the way the reason it is so critically important that every one of us know General Suleimani's name is because Russia is in Syria right now because the head of the Quds force traveled to Russia and talked Vladimir Putin into aligning themselves with Iran and Syria to prop up Bashar al- Assad. Russia is a bad actor but Vladimir Putin is someone we should not talk to because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side and we have all of that within our control. We could rebuild the Sixth Fleet. I will. We haven't. We could rebuild the missile defense program. We haven't. I will. We could also to Senator Rubio's point give the Egyptians what they've asked for which is intelligence. We could give the Jordanians what they've asked for... ...bombs and materiel. We have not supplied it... ...I will. We could arm the Kurds. They've been asking us for three years. All of this is within our control. ...Jake... ...Jake ... And then it'll be my turn. Jake? Jake? Dana I'd like to... Dana I would like to link these two issues both of which are incredibly important Iran and Planned Parenthood. One has something to do with the defense of the security of this nation. The other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation. You have not heard a plan about Iran from any politician up here here is my plan. On day one in the Oval Office I will make two phone calls the first to my good friend to Bibi Netanyahu to reassure him we will stand with the state of Israel. The second to the supreme leader to tell him that unless and until he opens every military and every nuclear facility to real anytime anywhere inspections by our people not his we the United States of America will make it as difficult as possible and move money around the global financial system. We can do that we don't need anyone's cooperation to do it. And every ally and every adversary we have in this world will know that the United States in America is back in the leadership business which is how we must stand with our allies. As regards Planned Parenthood anyone who has watched this videotape I dare Hillary Clinton Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table it's heart beating it's legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. This is about the character of our nation and if we will not stand up in and force President Obama to veto this bill shame on us.
2015-09-16 00:00:00,bush," I'm Jeb Bush and I believe America's on the verge of its greatest century and I'm ready to lead. I'm a committed conservative reformer that cut taxes that balanced budgets that took on the special interest in Florida and we won. I look forward to talking tonight about how we can fix a broken Washington D.C. and create an environment where people can rise up again in this great country. Thank you. I think the voters will make that determination. But what I know to be true is that the next president of the United States is going to have to fix an extraordinary difficult situation. This administration with President Obama and Hillary Clinton has created insecurity the likes of which we never would've imagined. There's not a place in the world where we're better off today than six and a half years ago. And that requires a steadiness. That requires an understanding of how the world works. That requires an understanding and appreciation of American leadership in the world. You can't just you know talk about this stuff and insult leaders around the world and expect a good result. You have to do this with a steady hand and I believe I have those skills. No. Absolutely not. People are supporting me because I have a proven record of conservative leadership where I cut taxes $19 billion over eight years. We shrunk the state government workforce we created a climate that led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating. People know that we need principle-centered leadership a disrupter to go to Washington D.C. The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something that was generous and gave me money was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida Yes you did. You wanted it and you didn't get it because I was opposed to casino gambling before during and after. And that's not I'm not going to be bought by anybody. No way. Believe me. Not even possible. You've got according to your to what you said on one of the talk shows you got Hillary Clinton to go to your wedding because you gave her money. Maybe it works for Hillary Clinton it doesn't work for anybody on this on stage. But the simple fact is No. The simple fact is Donald you could not take I was asked the question. So he supports Pelosi he supports Schumer he supports Clinton When he and he when he asked when he asked Florida to have casino gambling we said no. We said no. And that's the simple fact. The simple fact is Don't cut me off. No I don't think so but we need to be strong against China. We should use offensive tactics as it relates to cyber security send a deterrent signal to China. There should be super sanctions in what President Obama has proposed. There's many other tools that we have without canceling a dinner. That's not going to change anything but we can be much stronger as it relates to that. As it relates to Iran it's not a strategy to tear up an agreement. A strategy would be how do we confront Iran? And the first thing that we need to do is to establish our commitment to Israel which has been altered by this administration. And make sure that they have the most sophisticated weapons to send a signal to Iran that we have Israel's back. If we do that it's going to create a healthier deterrent effect than anything else I can think of. I don't think you're not stating my views right. I think there needs to be accommodation for someone acting on faith. Religious conscience is is is a first freedom. It's it's a powerful part of our of our Bill of Rights. And in a big tolerant country we should respect the rule of law allow people in in in this country I'm a I was opposed to the decision but we you can't just say ""well they gays can't get married now."" But this woman there should be some accommodation for her conscience just as there should be for people that are florists that don't want to participate in weddings or bakers. A great country like us should find a way to have accommodations for people so that we can solve the problem in the right way. This should be solved at the local level... And so we do agree Mike. Well he's wrong on a lot of things but on this he's wrong because I'm the most pro-life governor on this stage. I got to act on my core beliefs. It's part of who I am. Life is a gift from God. And from beginning end we need to respect it and err on the side of life. And so I defunded Planned Parenthood. We created a climate where parental notification took place. We were the only state to fund crisis pregnancy centers with state moneys. We were totally focused on this. And I would bring that kind of philosophy to Washington D.C. So here is a solution to this. Title X of the HHS funding there is something that was the ""Reagan Rule."" It was passed in 1988. And in that rule it was defined and the courts approved this that a Planned Parenthood you couldn't separate the money between the actual abortion procedures and there are 330000 abortions that take place in this clinic and their promotion of it. He interpreted it the right way the courts ruled in his favor and Planned Parenthood did not get funding during that time until President Clinton came in. When I'm elected president we will restore that interpretation of Title X. And this deal will be finished. I'm Jeb Bush and I believe America's on the verge of its greatest century and I'm ready to lead. I'm a committed conservative reformer that cut taxes that balanced budgets that took on the special interest in Florida and we won.

2015-09-16 00:00:00,kasich," Hello I'm John Kasich the Governor of Ohio. Emma and Reese my children and Karen love 'ya girls. Thanks for watching tonight. By the way I think I actually flew on this plane with Ronald Reagan when I was a congressman and his goals and mine really much are pretty much the same. Lift Americans unify give hope grow America and restore it is to that great shining city on a hill. Yes he was a great one and I learned much from watching him. The most important thing hope to Americans unify lift everyone in America. Jake Jake. Listen you know I if I were sitting at home and watch thing back and forth I would be inclined to turn it off. I mean people at home want to know across this country they want to know what we're going to do to fix this place how we'll balance a budget how we're going to create more economic growth how we'll pay down the debt. What we're going to do to strengthen the military. So we just spent 10 minutes here... But but wait a minute. It's a lot of ad hogshead. Now I know that it may be buzzing out there but I think it's important we get to the issues because that's what people want and they don't want all this fighting. ...Yeah well... Well let me just say this. First of all I think it's a bad agreement I would never have done it. But you know a lot of our problems in the world today is that we don't have the relationship with our allies. If we want to go everywhere alone we will not have the strength as (ph) if we could rebuild with our allies. Now this agreement we don't know what's going to happen in 18 months. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. I've seen lots of issues in foreign affairs and foreign in terms of global politics you have to be steady. Now here's the if they cheat we slap the sanctions back on. If they help Hamas and Hezbollah we slap the sanctions back on. And if we find out that they may be developing a nuclear weapon than the military option is on the table. We are stronger when we work with the Western civilization our friends in Europe and just doing it on our own I don't think is the right policy. No no no. I want to I want to I want to say something about what the senator just said. No one is no let me let me suggest to you we believe that we operate better in the world when our allies work with us. President Bush did it in the Gulf War. We work better when we are unified. Secondly nobody's trusting Iran. They violate the deal we put on the sanctions and we have the high moral ground to talk to our allies in Europe to get them to go with us. If they don't go with us we slap the sanctions on anyway. If they fund these radical groups that threaten Israel and all of the West then we should rip up the deal and put the sanctions back on. And let me make it clear let me make it clear... ... if we think if we think they're getting close to a to developing a nuclear weapon and we get that information you better believe that I would do everything in my power as the commander-in-chief to stop them having a nuclear weapon. We can have it and we can have our allies and we can be strong as a country and we can project across this globe with unity not just doing it alone. That is not what gets us where we want to get as a nation. Well I agree that we should defund Planned Parenthood. I don't know many people in America who don't think that we should and in my state we're trying to figure out how to get it done because we are threatened with the federal government taking all of our Medicaid money away. I think there is a way to get this done by giving governors the ability to be able to act to defund Planned Parenthood. But when (ph) it comes to closing down the federal government you gotta be very careful about that. When we shut the government down if we have a chance at success and it's a great principle yes. The president of the United States is not going to sign this and all we're gonna do is shut the government down and then we're gonna open up open it up and the American people are gonna shake their heads and say ""what's the story with these Republicans?"" So I think there is a way to get to cutting off the funding for Planned Parenthood. I was in the Congress for 18 years balanced the budget cut taxes got it done. Changed welfare went around the president to get welfare reform done. There are ways to do it without having to shut the government down but I'm sympathetic to the fact that we don't want this organization to get funding and the money ought to be reprogrammed for family planning in other organizations that don't support this tactic. But I would not be for shutting the government down... ...because I don't think it's going to work out. We're not what I can tell you is this. We didn't surrender in New Jersey six years ago as the brand new first ever pro-life governor of New Jersey since Roe versus Wade I defended Planned Parenthood. And I've vetoed Planned Parenthood funding now eight times in New Jersey. Since the day I walked in as governor Planned Parenthood has not been funded in New Jersey. We stood up and every one of those vetoes has been sustained. But here's the problem we're we're fighting with each other up here. We agree. Let's ask Hillary Clinton. She believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb to preserve their body parts... ...Dana in a way that maximizes their value for sale for profit. It is disgusting and the American people need to hear it... ...we shouldn't be fighting with each other. She's the real opponent she's the real problem. I'll tell you what I'll tell you what I'd be willing to fight for. I'll tell you what I'd be willing to fight for. Why will (ph) we put tax reform on the president's desk so we can simplify this tax system? No no it's really important Dana. We got to talk about what we would be willing to shut down for. Why don't we put tax reform on this president's desk and make him veto it if that's what he wants to do? Why haven't we repealed and replaced Obamacare? Make him veto if that's what he wants to do.

2015-09-16 00:00:00,walker, Good evening I'm Scott Walker and tonight I want to thank and Mrs. Reagan and the Reagan Library for hosting us. You see in my lifetime the greatest president was a governor from California. Ronald Reagan knew how to go big and go bold. He understood the essence of moving this country forward and that's what I did when I took on the status quo in my state and the Washington based special interest. Now more than ever America needs a leader who will go big and bold again. Someone who's been tested. I'm ready to be that leader. Thank you. But Jake Jake Jake Jake... But Jake this this is this... Jake this is this is this is... This is actually what's wrong this is what's wrong with this debate. We're not talking about real issues. And Mr. Trump we don't need an apprentice in the White House. We don't need an apprentice in the White House. We have one right now. He told us all the things we wanted to hear back in 2008. We don't know who you are or where you're going. We need someone who can actually get the job done. And you talked about business. You you let me finish... No no... You're using the talking... Mr. Trump you're using the talking points of the Democrats... ... and as we all know... ... that failed three times in four and a half years when I got elected because it is working. We balanced a budget. You want to talk about balanced budgets? You took four major projects into bankruptcy over and over and over again. You can't take America into bankruptcy. That's what's wrong with the politicians in Washington right now. They think we can take a country into bankruptcy. Jake yeah absolutely I'll take this on because this is an issue that's important in this race. Just because he says it doesn't make it true. The facts are the facts. We balanced a $3.6 billion budget deficit we did it by cutting taxes $4.7 billion to help working families family farmers small business owners and senior citizens. And it's about time people in America stand up and take note of this. If you want someone that can actually take on the special interest of Washington which you yourself said you were part of using the system we need somebody that will stand up and fight for average Americans to put them back in charge of their government. I'm the one who is taking that on. I'll do that as your next president. Two parts to that one on China one back for a second on Iran. When it comes to China why would we be giving an official state visit to a country that's been involved in a massive cyber attack against the United States? That's not just a visit that's a 21 gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House. It just doesn't make any sense. If we're ever going to send a message to them wouldn't this be the time when they've issued this sort of massive attack against us? And Jake for the question I was one of the first ones to call for terminating the bad deal with Iran on day one. The President came after me and said I need to bone up. You know the President who called ISIS the JV squad said I needed to bone up. The reality is it's a bad deal on day one and it's a bad deal because this president has allowed Iran to go closer and closer. I'd love to play cards with this guy because Barack Obama folds on everything with Iran. We need a leader who's going to stand up and actually ...

If we're ever going to send a message to them wouldn't this be the time when they've issued this sort of massive attack against us? And Jake for the question I was one of the first ones to call for terminating the bad deal with Iran on day one. The President came after me and said I need to bone up. You know the President who called ISIS the JV squad said I needed to bone up. The reality is it's a bad deal on day one and it's a bad deal because this president has allowed Iran to go closer and closer. I'd love to play cards with this guy because Barack Obama folds on everything with Iran. We need a leader who's going to stand up and actually ...
2015-09-16 00:00:00,paul," Good evening everyone. I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green Kentucky. My wife Kelly and I have been married for nearly 25 years and I spend my days defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I think there's nothing more important than understanding that the Constitution restrains government not the people. Thank you. I kind of have to laugh when I think of ""Mmm sounds like a non sequitur."" He was asked whether or not he would be capable and it would be in good hands to be in charge of the nuclear weapons and all of a sudden there's a sideways attack at me. I think that really goes to really the judgment. Do we want someone with that kind of character that kind of careless language to be negotiating with Putin? Do we want someone like that to be negotiating with Iran? I think really there's a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump but I am worried. I'm very concerned about him having him in charge of the nuclear weapons because I think his response his his visceral response to attack people on their appearance short tall fat ugly my goodness that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that? Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal? I think this goes back to essentially what we've been saying for the last two or three questions. Carly Fiorina also said we're not going to talk with Putin. Well think if Reagan had said that during the Cold War? We continued to talk with the Russians throughout the Cold War which is much more significant that where we are now. Should we continue to talk with Iran? Yes. Should we cut up the agreement immediately? That's absurd. Wouldn't you want to know if they complied? Now I'm going to vote against the agreement because I don't think there's significant leverage but it doesn't mean that I would immediately not look at the agreement and cut it up without looking to see if whether or not Iran has complied. The same goes with China. I don't think we need to be rash I don't think we need to be reckless and I think need to leave lines of communication open. Often we talk about whether we should be engaged in the world or disengaged in the world and I think this is an example of some who want to isolate us actually and not be engaged. We do need to be engaged with Russia. It doesn't mean we give them a free pass or China a free pass but to be engaged to continue to talk. We did throughout the Cold War and it would be a big mistake not to do it here. I think this gets to the point of wisdom on when to intervene and when we shouldn't. Had we bombed Assad at the time like President Obama wanted and like Hillary Clinton wanted and many Republicans wanted I think ISIS would be in Damascus today. I think ISIS would be in charge of Syria had we bombed Assad. Sometimes both sides of the civil war are evil and sometimes intervention sometimes makes us less safe. This is real the debate we have to have in the Middle East. Every time we have toppled a secular dictator we have gotten chaos the rise of radical Islam and we're more at risk. So I think we need to think before we act and know most interventions if not a lot of them in the Middle East have actually backfired on us. Good evening everyone.

None of us on this state are under investigation by the FBI because we destroyed government records or because we leaked secrets. I know that there are some in the Wall-Street-to-Washington axis of power who speak of all of us contemptuously. But I'm here to say that I think we are in fact the A team. We have some remarkable people and in fact not only are we the A team; we even have our own Mr. T who doesn't mind saying about others ""you're a fool."" And I'm delighted to be here with all of these guys and would put any of them in an administration that I led. Thank you very much. I would certainly love to get in on this because I think the single... I've been patiently waiting and I'm going to just say this about Iran. Because I think it is incredibly important. This is really about the survival of Western civilization. This is not just a little conflict with a Middle Eastern country that we've just now given over $100 billion to the equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion. This threatens Israel immediately this threatens the entire Middle East but it threatens the United States of America. And we can't treat a nuclear Iranian government as if it is just some government that would like to have power. This is a government for 36 years has killed Americans they kidnapped Americans they have maimed Americans. They have sponsored terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah and they threaten the very essence of Western civilization. To give them this agreement that the president treats like the Magna Carta but Iranians treat it like it's toilet paper and we must simply make it very clear that the next president one of us on this stage will absolutely not honor that agreement and will destroy it and will be tough with Iran because otherwise we put every person in this world in a very dangerous place. No I don't think he's on the wrong side of such an issue. Jeb is a friend. I'm not up here to fight with Jeb or to fight with anybody else. But I am here to fight for somebody who is a county clerk elected under the Kentucky constitution that 75 percent of the people of that state had voted for that said that marriage was between a man and a woman. The Supreme Court in a very very divided decision decided out of thin air that they were just going to redefine marriage. It's a decision that the other justices in dissent said they didn't have and there wasn't a constitutional shred of capacity for them to do it. I thought that everybody here passed ninth-grade civics. The courts cannot legislate. That's what Roberts said. But heck it's what we learned in civics. The courts can't make a law. They can interpret one. They can review one. They can't implement it. They can't force it. But here's what happened: Because the courts just decided that something was going to be and people relinquished it and the other two branches of government sat by silently I thought we had three branches of government they were all equal to each other we have separation of powers and we have checks and balances. If the court can just make a decision and we just all surrender to it we have what Jefferson said was judicial tyranny. The reason that this is a real issue that we need to think about... No no. Let me finish this one thought Jake. I haven't gotten that much time so I'm going to take just what little I can here. We made accommodation to the Fort Hood shooter to let him grow a beard. We made accommodations to the detainees at Gitmo I've been to Gitmo and I've seen the accommodations that we made to the Muslim detainees who killed Americans.

2016-04-14 00:00:00,sanders," Wolf thank you very much. CNN thank you very much. Secretary Clinton thank you very much. When we began this campaign almost a year ago we started off at 3 percent in the polls. We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. In the last couple of weeks there were two polls out there that had us ahead. Of the last nine caucuses and primaries we have won eight of them many of them by landslide victories. Over the last year we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions averaging guess what $27 apiece more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign.The reason that our campaign has done so well is because we're doing something very radical: We're telling the American people the truth. And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision... ... and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections. This campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer and create an economy that works for all of us not just the 1 percent.Thank you. Well I've known Secretary Clinton how long 25 years? We worked together in the Senate. And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton uh campaign. ""Washington Post"" headline says ""Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified"" and that's what the surrogates were saying.Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?Of course she does. But I do question... ...but I do question her judgment. I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq... ...the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests including $15 million from Wall Street.I don't believe that that is... ...the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need. And let's talk about judgment. And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country... I led the opposition to that war. Secretary Clinton voted for that. Well let's talk about judgment. Let's talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s money which is completely undisclosed.Where does the money come from?Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she's going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?I don't think so. We have... ... ... Thirdly we have got to understand that in America we should be thinking big not small. We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people. So I... ...my . First Dana... That's right. So let's start off with the basic premise. A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars. What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was essentially that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans. Goldman Sachs was not the only bank other banks of course did the same. Now I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks A because they're based on fraudulent principles and B because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country they are just too big too much concentration of wealth and power. The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system. Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail. You've got to be a certain size. And then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off. I don't know that it's appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions. What we need is to make sure that they are safe. Sure. Sure. The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession the Great Depression of the '30s when millions of people lost their jobs and their homes and their life savings the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up. That was my view way back and I introduced legislation to do that. Now Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225000 a speech. So the problem response the proper response in my view is we should break them up. And that's what my legislation does. Secretary Clinton called them out. Oh my goodness they must have been really crushed by this. And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements? So they must have been very very upset by what you did. Look here is the difference and here is the clear difference. These banks in my view have too much power. They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.If elected president I will break them up. We have got legislation to do that end of discussion. Well let me respond. Secretary Clinton you just heard her everybody else does it she'll do it. I will do it. I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors not for $225000 not for $2000 not for two cents. There were no speeches. And second of all of course we will release our taxes. Jane does our taxes. We've been a little bit busy lately. You'll excuse us. But we will... We will get them out. Well I think we got one that's coming out tomorrow. Last year's. Yes. You'll get them yes. Yeah look I don't want to get anybody very excited. They are very boring tax returns. No big money from speeches no major investments. Unfortunately unfortunately I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate. And that's what that will show. Yes. Yes. Wolf the answer is you know what we have always done in my family is Jane does them. And she's been out on the campaign trail. We will get them out. We'll get them out very shortly. It's not a big deal. Well for a start I would tell the gentleman who's the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America. And this is this is a perfect example Wolf of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country. This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary. That's his that's his compensation. This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers outsource call center jobs to the Philippines and and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs. He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America. First of all the word contempt is not right. There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect. Verizon happens not to be one of them. And what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt who's the head of General Electric he doesn't like me well that's fine. He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world... ...cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year by the way it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric in a given year pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits. Well for a start we're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. And number two while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonald's at the end of the day what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs. We cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20 30 years based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those. That has got to change. I'm going to respond... Well look... Well look... I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. . . That's just not accurate. Well... ...well and I... Excuse me. Well... OK. I will... I believe I was... ...responding. All right? When this campaign began I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25 raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12. There's a difference. And by the way what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton because all over this country people are standing up and they're saying $12 is not good enough we need $15 an hour. And suddenly... To suddenly... To suddenly announce now that you're for $15 I don't think is quite accurate. Well I think the secretary has confused a lot of people. I don't know how you're there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage. Now in fact in fact there is an effort Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage. That's good. I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better. And ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages... I think we have got to be clear not equivocate $15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible. Well the only problem is Wolf she didn't answer your question. You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible. You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence. You made the point what she said was totally absurd. Then why did she put out that statement? ...Excuse me I think I'm responding now. A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont who was a supporter of hers who said yeah in campaigns people tend to exaggerate. Here is the fact on guns. Let's talk about guns. That horrible horrible Sandy Hook what's the word we want to use murder assault slaughter unspeakable act.Back in 1988 I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont. I probably lost that election which I lost by three points because I was the only candidate running who said you know what? We should ban assault weapons not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America.I've got a D-minus voting record from the NRA. And in fact because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country. What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them. Now I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody and that person then goes out and kills somebody I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.But what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them somebody walks in.They want thousands of rounds of ammunition or they want a whole lot of guns yes that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable. No I don't think I owe them an apology. They are in court today and actually they won a preliminary decision today. They have the right to sue and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue. Let me just reiterate just reiterate so there is no confusion decades ago before it was popular in a rural state with no gun control Bernie Sanders said let's ban assault weapons not see them distributed in the United States of America. Because it was a racist term and everybody knew it was a racist term. Look much of what Secretary Clinton said was right. We had a crime bill. I voted for it. It had the Violence Against Women Act in it. When as mayor of Burlington we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence. This took us a good step forward. We're talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook. This banned assault weapons not insignificant.But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system. We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. And in my view what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up. And that means for a start and we don't talk about this. The media doesn't talk about it you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed. You know what I think? Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids not jails and incarceration. And I'll tell you what else. And I'll tell you what else I think. And that is we have got and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it. We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs. Too many lives... Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana millions over a 30-year period. And that is why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act. We're going to work with state governments all over this country. And you know what? In a very divided Congress and a very divided politics in America actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it's insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people. With federal and presidential leadership we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities. On this one Errol actually I think you're going to see progressive and conservative support. We can do it if we're prepared to be bold. It is one thing as the Secretary indicated to talk about workers. I'm sure I have contributions you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country. But as I understand it 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign. Now that's not saying and then some people say well given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it's a small amount. That's true. But that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.Now what I think is when we look at climate change now we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency. And it is not good enough. You know if we God forbid were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it. That was what 9/11 was about.We have an enemy out there and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances. There's going to be international conflict. I am proud Wolf that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation... ... Including a tax on carbon. Something I don't believe Secretary Clinton supports. ... Let's talk about that. When you were Secretary of State you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world. The issue here of course the agreement is a step forward but you know agreements and I know agreements there's a lot of paper there. We've got to get beyond paper right now.We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system not tomorrow but yesterday. And what that means Wolf it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry. Now I am on board legislation that says you know what we ain't going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land. That's not Secretary Clinton's position. Let us support a tax on carbon... ... Not Secretary Clinton's position. Wolf. Wolf. All right here is here is a real difference. This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough. Not right now. Not on climate change. Now the truth is as secretary of state Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world. Second of all right now we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. And that means and I would ask you to respond. Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do? Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question. Are you for a tax on carbon or not? No they wouldn't. Look here's where we are. Let me reiterate. We have a global crisis. Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course. Our legislation understands Errol that there will be economic dislocation. It is absolutely true. There will be some people who lose their job. And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers. It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate. But we have got to stand up and say right now as we would if we were attacked by some military force we have got to move urgently and boldly.What does that mean? Well you don't it all out tomorrow. And you certainly don't phase nuclear out tomorrow. But this is what you do do. What you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program and I had introduced introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops. We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country. Saving rebuilding our rail system. Our mass transit system. If we approach this Errol as if we were literally at a war you know in 1941 under Franklin Delano Roosevelt we moved within three years within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism. That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now. Lead the world. According to ""The New York Times.""... ...for President Obama this was a pretty tough call like a 51-49 call do you overthrow Qadafi who of course was a horrific dictator? ""The New York Times"" told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change. And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq. Look... ...Qadafi Saddam Hussein are brutal brutal murdering thugs. No debate about that.But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn't think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold. And I think if you studied the whole history of... ...American involvement in regime change you see that quite often. No. Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn't make it truer. What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent you know what that is where basically do we support Libya moving to democracy? Well you know what I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy. But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after. Totally different issue. Second of all second of all if I might in terms of Syria in terms of Syria... If you listen you know two points. Number one yes 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again. But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be. Second of all I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here but you in Syria you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone which the president certainly does not support nor do I support because A it will cost an enormous sum of money second of all it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.Thirdly when we talk about Syria right now no debate like Gadhafi like Saddam Hussein Assad is another brutal murdering dictator but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first and to get rid of Assad second. Well what I believe if my memory is correct here we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO. Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education college education for their people the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education you know what yeah I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense. Yes I do. Well you got to ask you got to ask Trump. All I can tell you is with a huge deficit with 47 million people living in poverty with our inner cities collapsing yeah I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy or at least its standard of living and health care and education they're doing pretty well. So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies you know what the United States of America cannot just support your economies. You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden. Nothing wrong with that. Well as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel who has family in Israel of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack. That is not a debate. But but what you just read yeah I do believe that. Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks has every right in the world to destroy terrorism. But we had in the Gaza area not a very large area some 10000 civilians who were wounded and some 1500 who were killed. Now if you're asking not just me but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack the answer is that I believe it was and let me say something else. And let me say something else. As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel in the long run and this is not going to be easy God only knows but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity. So what is not to say to say that right now in Gaza right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%. You got a log of that area continues it hasn't been built decimated houses decimated health care decimated schools decimated. I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.That does not make me anti-Israel. That paves the way I think... ...to an approach that works in the Middle East. I don't think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country. That is not the issue. And you evaded the answer. You evaded the question. The question is not does Israel have a right to respond nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism. That's not the debate. Was their response disproportionate?I believe that it was you have not answered that. I read Secretary Clinton's statement speech before AIPAC. I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people. Almost none in that speech. So here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.That is what I believe the world wants to us do and that's the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise. There comes a time there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time. You gave a major speech to AIPAC which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis and you barely mentioned the Palestinians. And I think again it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents including President Clinton and others Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing. All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided. There are two sides to the issue. Well first of all I disagree with that study. There are many economists who come up with very very different numbers. For example we are the only country major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do 50 percent more than the French. My proposal a Medicare-for-all single-payer program will save... ...will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs. Public colleges and universities tuition free? Damn right. That is exactly what we should be doing. And I'd pay for that I'd pay for that by telling Wall Street that yeah we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt.Wolf we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent. The establishment does not like this idea but yes I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country. I know what Secretary Clinton is saying. We are not a country that has the courage to stand up to big money and do what has to be done for the working families of the country. Secretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people spending significantly less per capita than we can.I live 50 miles away from Canada you know? It's not some kind of communist authoritarian country. They're doing OK. They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people. We can do the same.In terms of public colleges and universities please don't tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing. Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt for what crime? For trying to get an education. So yes we are going to pay for it... An interesting comment but you didn't answer the question. No you didn't. My legi... Can I answer... ...may I please... ...can I have... ...do I not? All right. Essentially what you described is my legislation which includes ... Now we've got here is the issue. Your answer has been the same year after year. In fact the idea that I'm bringing forth I have to admit it you know it wasn't my idea. It was Barack Obama's idea in 2008 the exact same idea. He called for lifting the cap which is now higher it's at 118 and starting at 250 and going on up. If you do that you're going to extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. You will significantly expand benefits by 1300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16000 a year.What's wrong with that?Are you prepared to support it? You have sup... All right so... Look Wolf... ...I am very glad that... I am very glad to... ...campaign of challenging if I hear you correctly Madam Secretary you are now coming out finally in favor of lifting the cap on taxable income... ...and extending and expanding Social Security. If that is the case welcome on board. I'm glad you're here. ...I'm still... I've got to admit... ...maybe I'm a little bit confused. Are you or are you not supporting legislation to lift the cap on taxable income and expand Social Security for 58 years and increase benefits... ...yes or no? Oh you ah. OK. Well look... Let me interject here. Yes Secretary Clinton... ...you are a member of the establishment. . Well there is no question. I mean it really is an outrage. And it just continues the seven-and-a-half years of unbelievable obstructionism we have seen from these right-wing Republicans. I mean a third-grader in America understands the president of the United States has the right to nominate individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court. Apparently everybody understands that except the Republicans in Congress. Yes but here is the point and obviously i will strongly support that nomination as a member of the Senate. But if elected president I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination because I think I think this. I think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear and this nominee has not yet done that crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined. You're looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose who will take on those governors right now who are discriminating outrageously against the LGBT community who comes from a state which led the effort for gay marriage in this country proudly so. Who not only thinks we are not going to not defund Planned Parenthood we've got to expand funding for Planned Parenthood. Well why would I be running for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States? But here is a good point. You know in virtually all of the general election match-up polls between Trump and Secretary Clinton and Trump and Bernie Sanders in almost all of those polls I do better than Secretary Clinton both in the CNN poll I was 20 points ahead of Trump.I think Secretary Clinton was 12 points. And you know why? Because in fact a whole lot of people this may be a shock to the secretary but there a whole lot of independents in this country. And we are not going to win the White House based on just long-term Democratic votes. We have got to reach out to independents and I think I am well qualified to do that. I am in this race as a Democrat. I have raised millions of dollars for my colleagues in the United States Senate to help them get elected. I will do everything I can to open the Democratic party to the young people who are flocking into our political campaign. The truth is and you can speak to my colleagues we have raised millions of dollars to the DSCC. I have written letter that have raised if I may use the word huge amount of money so that's just not accurate. But I will also say and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it and I do believe I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people. And I think the future of the Democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors. I think that the way we are doing it in this campaign... $27 a contribution... not being dependent on Wall Street or big money that is the future of the Democratic Party that I want to see. ... Let me if I may just briefly say something... I think we're going to win this nomination to tell you the truth. Look let me acknowledge what is absolutely true. Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South. No question about it. We got murdered there. That is the most conservative part of this great country. That's the fact.But you know what? We're out of the Deep South now. And we're moving up. We got here. We're going to California. We got a number of large states there. And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is yeah I believe that we're going to win this nomination and I believe we're going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is. The reason the reason why in virtually every contest we are winning by very strong margins younger people and I'm not just talking about very young. You know the older you get the younger young gets 45 or younger is I think people are sensing that establishment politics and dependence on Wall Street and big money interest is really never going to address the crises that we face. And people understand you can't take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe you're going to stand up to these powerful special interests. So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process... ... many of whom previously had given up. I grew up in Brooklyn New York... ...the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket never made a whole lot of money but was a very proud American because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college. I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life. And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country. I just don't accept that.What I believe is that this country if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up can guarantee health care to all people as a right can have paid family and medical leave can make public colleges and universities tuition-free can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change can break up the large financial institutions can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.And we can do that when millions of people stand up fight back and create a government that works for all of us not just the 1 percent. That is what the political revolution is about. That is what this campaign is about. And with your help we're going to win here in New York. Thank you. Thank you."
2016-04-14 00:00:00,clinton," Well first of all it's great to be here in New York and I am delighted to... ... have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future. I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years... ...and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead. And during those eight years we faced some difficult challenges together. We faced 9/11. We worked hard to rebuild New York. I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who'd been affected in their health by what they had experienced. We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together. And that is that is exactly what I want to do as your president. We will celebrate our diversity. We will work together bringing us back to being united setting some big bold progressive goals for America. That's what I'm offering in this campaign to build on the work to build on the value that we share here in New York to take those to Washington and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans bur our country from reaching our full potential. That is what my campaign is about. Well it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified. I've been called a lot of things in my life. That was a first. And then he did say that... ...he had to question my judgment. Well the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and... ...and... ...and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States. So look we have disagreements on policy. There's no doubt about it. But if you go and read which I hope all of you will before Tuesday Senator Sanders' long interview with the ""New York Daily News"" talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue breaking up the banks.When asked he could not explain how... ...that would be done and... ...when asked... ...when asked about a number of foreign policy issues he could not answer about Afghanistan about Israel about counterterrorism except to say if he'd had some paper in front of him maybe he could.I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief. Well let me... ...let me just say... ...let me...let me say... OK. Well make make no mistake about it this is not just an attack on me it's an attack on President Obama. President Obama... You know let me tell you why. You may not like the answer but I'll tell you why. President Obama had a super PAC when he ran. President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors. And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank the toughest regulations... ...on Wall Street in many a year.So this is this is a phony this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks. Absolutely. You know this is what I've saying for the past year. No bank is too big to fail no executive too powerful to jail. I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd-Frank. I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken. I believe and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.There are two sections there. If they fail either one that they're a systemic risk a grave risk to our economy or if they fail the other that their living wills which is what you're referring to is inadequate.Let's look at what is at stake here. We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again. I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York. I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law. We've got to execute under it. So you're right. I will move immediately to break up any financial institution but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry. The big insurance companies the hedge funds something that I have been arguing for now a long time... Dana you know I love being in Brooklyn. Dana let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank which is after all the law we passed under President Obama and I'm proud that Barney Frank one of the authors has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is yes sometimes the government may have to order certain actions. Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions. That has to be the judgement of the regulators.But there's another element to this. I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement. They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions. And hold them accountable as well. Well you can tell Dana he cannot come up with any example because there is no example. It is important it's always important. It may be inconvenient but it's always important to get the facts straight. I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.I called them out on their mortgage behavior. I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code. When I went to the secretary of state office the president President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.That is the law. Now this is our ninth debate. In the prior eight debates I have said we have a law. You don't just say we're upset about this. I'm upset about it. You don't just say go break them up. You have a law because we are a nation of laws. So I support Dodd-Frank but I have consistently said that's not enough. We've got to include the shadow banking sector. You know first of all first of all there isn't an issue. When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York I did stand up to the banks. I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused. I'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives as Senator Sanders did which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.Now if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession you've got to look at the whole picture. It was a giant insurance company AIG. It was an investment bank Lehman Brothers. It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.I'm not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives... ... but the fact is he did. And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade... I have said look there are certain there are certain expectations when you run for president. This is a new one. And I've said if everybody agrees to do it because there are speeches for money on the other side. I know that. But I will tell you this there is there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns and you can go you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns. And I've released 30 years of tax returns. And I think every candidate including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump should do the same. Right. You know let's set the same standard for everybody. When everybody does it OK I will do it but let's set and expect the same standard on tax returns. Everybody does it and then we move forward. Well you know there are a lot of copy machines around. Well first of all I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach. And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing. I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would I believe really jump-start advanced manufacturing. I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business. And that's exactly what I will do.When I was secretary of State I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world which supports tens of thousands of jobs.So I think you've got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America. And that's exactly what my plan would bring about.I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened... ...in the 1990s we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody. Let's do that again in America. Well of course I would. And I have supported... ...I have supported the fight for 15. I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15. I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage. I always have. I supported that when I was in the Senate. But what I have also said is that we've got to be smart about it just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York. If you look at it we moved more quickly to $15 in New York City more deliberately toward $12 $12.50 upstate then to $15. That is exactly my position. It's a model for the nation and that's what I will do as president. Go as quickly as... ...to get to $15. You know wait a minute... ...wait a minute. ...wait wait... Come on I have stood on the debate stage... ...with Senator Sanders eight... ...times. I have said the... Exact same thing. If we can... ...raise it to $15 in New York... ...or Los Angeles or Seattle... ...let's do it. OK. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15. I supported those on the front lines of the fight for it happens to be true. I also I supported the $15 effort in L.A. I supported in Seattle. I supported it for the fast food workers in New York. The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25 right? We want to raise it higher than it ever has been but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher and I support that. I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate led by Senator Patty Murray and others like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference. Thirty-five million people will get a raise. One in four working mothers will get a raise. I want to get something done. And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go encouraging others to get to $15. But of course if we have a Democratic Congress we will go to $15. No of course not. Of course not. This is this is a serious difference between us. And what I want to start by saying it's not a laughing matter 90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns 33000 people a year. I take it really seriously because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.So yes we have a problem in America. We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby. We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms. And what we have here is a big difference. Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for the most important NRA priority namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15 which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon killing on the battlefield. He said they didn't deserve their day in court.I could not disagree more.And finally this is the only industry in America the only one. That has this kind of special protection. We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street and I agree. We've got to hold Wall Street accountable... ...Well what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America? I put it out... Well the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state. They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York. But let me say this in 1988 as we've heard on every debate occasion Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost. He came back in 1990 and he won and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.And in fact in his own book he talks about his 1990 campaign and here's what he said. He clearly was helped by the NRA because they ran ads against his opponent. So then he went to the Congress where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA. Voting he kept his word to the NRA he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.Thankfully enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them. Well I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it. This is a this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store that was not the point of this. And if he can point to any any incident where that happened I would love to hear about it.What was really going on I'll tell you because it has a lot to do with New York City. New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy. The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said stop it stop it now and Senator Sanders joined those who did. Well I think that it had some positive aspects to it. And you mentioned some of them. The Violence Against Women Act which has been a very important piece of legislation in my opinion. And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people. So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side there are some positive actions and changes.On the other side there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct. I think that sentences got much too long. The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders but once the federal government did what it did states piled on.So we have a problem. And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill and he says the same thing there were some good things and things that we have to change and learn from.So that's how I see it. And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start. To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning. Well look I supported the crime bill. My husband has apologized. He was the president who actually signed it Senator Sanders... ... voted for it. I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives. I've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.That's why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue Errol because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make. And I also want people... ...especially I want I want white people I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism. It's also in employment it's in housing but it is in the criminal justice system as well. Well look I think that as Senator Sanders said about what I said I will say about what he said. I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address. And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life I think the idea of investing early in kids early childhood education universal pre-K like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York. We have got to help more kids get off to a good start. That's why I want a good teacher in a good school for every child regardless of the ZIP Code that child lives in... ... and to be really focused on how we build ladders of opportunity and tear down these barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead. Well let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world. And that's why for the last many years both in the Senate and as secretary of State it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done. But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator I tried I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil. And I have proposed that again because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.And everyone who's looked at this independently ""The Washington Post"" and others who give us both hard times when called for on facts have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge.So we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies. Best we can tell from the reports that are done.But that is not being supported by big oil and I think it's important to distinguish that. And let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy. Well let's talk about the global environmental crisis. Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions. I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change. And I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement said it was not enough it didn't go far enough. You know at some point putting together 195 countries I know a little bit about that was a major accomplishment... ... And our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation not our criticism... Well I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress President Obama moved forward on gas mileage he moved forward on the clean power plant. He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take. And you know I am getting a little bit I'm getting a little bit concerned here because you know I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported. Now it's easy it's easy to diagnose the problem. It's harder to do something about the problem. And... No well I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil but principally coal to where we need to be which is clean renewable energy and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas. And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal building coal plants all the time also to get out from under especially if they were in Europe the pressure from Russia which has been incredibly intense. So we did say natural gas is a bridge. We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible because in order to deal with climate change we have got to move as rapidly as we can.That's why I've set big goals. I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years. So I have big bold goals but I know in order to get from where we are where the world is still burning way too much coal where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy. You know I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish building on the clean power plan which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress. I don't take a back seat to your legislation that you've introduced that you haven't been able to get passed. I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis. That's exactly what I have proposed. And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing. Well let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise. And here's what we did. We helped them hold two successful elections something that is not easy which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.I was very proud of that.We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had getting it out of Libya getting it away from militias or terrorist groups.We also worked to help them set up their government. We sent a lot of American experts there. We offered to help them secure their borders to train a new military.They at the end when it came to security issues Wolf did not want troops from any other country not just us European or other countries in Libya.And so we were caught in a very difficult position. They could not provide security on their own which we could see and we told them that but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security.And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country terrorists taking up some locations in the country.And we can't walk away from that. We need to be working with European and Arab partners... ...with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them. The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government. And I as president will keep trying to give that to them Yes well I... ...I... ...I I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support. Senator sanders voted for that and that's exactly what we did. We went to the United Nations yes he did. We went to the United Nations Security Council. We got support from the Security Council. And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners. This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them. And if you want to know what chaos does not just to the people inside but the people on the borders look at Syria.Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya. Well that isn't... There was also in that a reference to the Security Council and I know you're not shy when you oppose something Senator. So yes it was unanimous. That's exactly right including you. And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners. The decision was the president's. Did I do the due diligence? Did I talk to everybody I could talk to? Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president? Yes I did. That's what a secretary of state does.But at the end of the day those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power. And the president made that decision. And yes we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people. Well I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point. Yes when I was secretary of state I did urge along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out vet and train and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad. The president said no. Now that's how it works. People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision. So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.And yes I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe. I support our continuing involvement in NATO. And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost. There is a requirement that they should be doing so and I believe that needs to be enforced. But there's a larger question here. NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history. It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies that have many of the same values and interests and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face. So... ... yes of course they should be paying more but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave because I don't think that's in America's interests. I will stay in NATO. I will stay in NATO and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support. Remember NATO was with us in Afghanistan. Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan. They came to our rallying defense after 9/11. That meant a lot. And yes we have to work out the financial aspects of it but let's not forget what's really happening. With Russia being more aggressive making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe it is not in our interests. Think of how much it would cost if Russia's aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward. I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012. I did it in concert with... President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President Morsi based in Cairo working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet. I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks. They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages. They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel. And so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me I was in Cambodia that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn't find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it I flew all night I got there I negotiated that.So I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat terrorist tact rockets coming at you. You have a right to defend yourself. That does not mean that does not mean that you don't take appropriate precautions. And I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war. It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution which would give the Palestinians the rights and... ... just let me finish. The rights and the autonomy that they deserve. And let me say this if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years. I will certainly be willing to answer it. I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb it is terrible. I'm not saying it's anything other than terrible. It would be great remember Israel left Gaza. They took out all the Israelis. They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.And what happened? Hamas took over Gaza.So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere. Well if I I want to add you know again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it. And I have been involved both as first lady with my husband's efforts as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking and as secretary of state for President Obama I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel. There were only four of us in the room Netanyahu Abbas George Mitchell and me. Three long meetings. And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government. And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever ever undermining Israel's security. Well... ... you know I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders. Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right but it is a difficult position. If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist that is a very difficult challenge. Well again again I absolutely agree with the diagnosis the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage something that I've worked on for 25 years. Before there was something called Obamacare there was something called Hillarycare. And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent. And with respect to college I think we have to make college affordable. We are pricing out middle-class working and poor families. There's no doubt about that.But I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans... ...are actually going to work. And just very briefly on health care most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out remember he had a plan for about I don't know 18 20 years. He changed in the middle of this campaign. He put out another plan. People have been analyzing the new plan. And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it progressive economists health economists and the like that it would pose an incredible burden not just on the budget but on individuals. In fact the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor. A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2300.The same for free college. The free college offer you know my late father said if somebody promises you something for free read the fine print. You read the fine print and here's what it says. The fine print says this that it will the federal government will cover two-thirds of the cost and require the states even those led by Republican governors... ... to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost. Well... We have we have a difference of opinion. We both want to get to universal health care coverage. I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces the health insurance companies and the drug companies. And perhaps that's why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama's signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act because I know how hard it was to get that passed even with a Democratic Congress. So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody... ... let's get to 100 percent coverage let's get the cost down and let's guarantee health care. I have said repeatedly Wolf I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. That is one way. If that is the way that we pursue I will follow that. But there are other ways. We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people. We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.But here's the real issue because I I've heard this I've seen the reports of it. I have said from the very beginning we are going to protect Social Security. I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.But we also in addition to extending the Trust Fund which I am absolutely determined to do we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now. And because Social Security started in the 1930s a lot of women have been left out and left behind.And it's time that we provide more benefits for widows divorcees for caregivers for women who deserve more from the Social Security... ...system and that will be my highest priority. I did. If that's the way we're... ...yes I did. I did answer the... Well don't don't put words... ...into my mouth and say something... ...that's not accurate. I have supported it. You know we are in vigorous agreement here Senator. I think it's important... ...to point out that... ...you know we're we're having a discussion about the best way to raise money from wealthy people to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. Think about what the other side wants to do. They're calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme. They still want to privatize it. In fact their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street something you and I would never let happen. So yes we both want to make sure... ...Social Security ... ...and well-funded... No. We are going... ...we are... ...we are going... I as he said I've said the same thing for years. I didn't say anything different tonight. We are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. There is still something called Congress. Now I happen to support Democrats and I want to get Democrats to take back the majority in the United States Senate... ...so a lot of a lot of what we're talking about can actually be implemented... ...when I am president. I am... I have said yes we are going to pick the best way or combination... ...or combination of ways... ...you know... ...it it's all it's always a little bit uh challenging because you know if Senator Sanders doesn't agree with how you are approaching something then you are a member of the establishment. Well let me say then... ...let me say this... ...we are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. We've got some good ideas to do it. Let's get a Congress elected... ...that will actually agree... ...with us in doing it. I am not going to contradict the president's strategy on this. And I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals. I fully support the president. And I believe that the president the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history. And the Senate needs to immediately begin to respond. So I'm going to support the president. When I am president I will take stock of where we are and move from there. You know there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V. Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned. And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake. We've had eight debates before this is our ninth. We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care not one question. And in the meantime we have states governors doing everything they can to restrict women's rights. We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished. And we are never asked about this.And to be complete in my concern Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction. I don't think it's a distraction. It goes to the heart of who we are as women our rights our autonomy our ability to make our own decisions and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks. Let us talk about where we are in this race. I've gotten more votes than anybody running. 9.6 million at the last count. That is 2.3 million more than Senator Sanders. And it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump. I think you have to look at the facts. And the facts are that I'm putting together a very broad-based inclusive coalition from the South to the North from the East to the West with African-American Latinos women union households working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running. It is a campaign that will not only capture the Democratic nomination but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republican end up nominating. And I want to say I also want to say that I do I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process. I applaud all of those who are applauding you Senator Sanders. We're happy that they are supporting you that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues. But let me also say it's going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed... And I know something about that... Thank you so much. Because when I went to the very end of the 2008 campaign with then Senator Obama... ... We did unify the party and we did elect a Democratic president... Now let me say this... I think it's I think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates. And my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than Barack Obama's lead was over me. And in addition to winning states in the Deep South we won Florida Texas Arizona Massachusetts Ohio Illinois North Carolina Missouri. And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic but it all comes down to reaching every single voter. I'm not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place.So I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday. I'm going to work in Pennsylvania Connecticut Rhode Island Delaware and Maryland all the way through California. And when we end up with the number of delegates we need we will unite the party and have a unified convention... ... that we'll go onto the general election with. Thank you. I am very grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave me the great honor of serving as your senator. You took a chance on me in 2000 and then you re-elected me with one of the biggest margins we've had in our state in 2006. During those years we worked closely together. I tried to have your back and time and time again you had mine. We took on the challenges of 9/11 together. We got the money to rebuild New York. We came to the aid of our brave first responders construction workers and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors. We worked to create jobs despite the disastrous policies of George W. Bush across New York. And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests.I'm asking for your support again in the primary on Tuesday to continue that work together to take what we did in New York and to take those New York values to the White House and put them to work on behalf of all of our people to knock down the barriers that stand in the way.You know of course we have economic barriers. I've been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life. But we also have racial barriers gender barriers homophobic barriers disability barriers. We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday. I'll work my heart out for you again. And together we won't just make promises we can't keep. We'll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America. That's what we'll do together. Thank you New York."
2016-04-14 00:00:00,louis," Secretary Clinton the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons. It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education. Looking at the bill as a whole do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake? Thank you Secretary. Now earlier this year a South Carolina voter told your daughter Chelsea quote ""I think a lot of African-Americans want to hear you know what we made a mistake."" Chelsea said she has heard you apologize but went on to say that if the voter hadn't heard it then quote ""it's clearly insufficient."" Do you regret your advocacy for the crime bill? But what about you Senator? Senator Sanders earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clinton's use of the term super-predator back in the '90s when she supported the crime bill. Why did you call him out? Thank you. Thank you. Let's let's get Secretary Clinton's response. Thank you. Thank you Secretary Clinton. Your time's up Secretary Clinton. Senator Sanders I have a question for you related to this. So you've said that by the end of your first term as president the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration. To fulfill that promise you'd have to release roughly half a million prisoners. How are you going to do that since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction? OK. Secretary Clinton as secretary of state you also pioneered a program to promote fracking around the world as you described. Fracking of course a way of extracting natural gas. Now as a candidate for president you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations fracking will be restricted in many places around the country. Why have you changed your view on fracking? Thank you Secretary. All right Senator? OK thank you Secretary Clinton. Senator Sanders you've said that climate change is the greatest change to our nation's security. Excuse me Senator Senator Senator Senator Senator... I have a question for you. You've said that climate change is the greatest threat to our nation's security. You've called for a nationwide ban on fracking. You've also called for phasing out all nuclear power in the U.S. But wouldn't those proposals drive the country back to coal and oil and actually undermine your fight against global warming? Senator senator jobs...jobs are one thing but with less than 6 percent of all U.S. energy coming from solar wind and geothermal and 20 percent of U.S. power coming from nuclear if you phase out all of that how do you make up that deficit? Secretary... Secretary... OK Secretary Clinton I've got a question for you from a reader... ...of the ""New York Daily News."" ...this was a reader... ...of ""The Daily News"" who sent us a... ...a question for you. Just a second Senator.Hannah Green wants to know your position Secretary Clinton regarding President Obama's nomination of Merrick Gaarland to the Supreme m Court. President Obama said earlier this week that he would not withdraw the nomination even after the presidential election. If elected would you ask the president to withdraw the nomination? Senator Sanders. So Senator Sanders would you ask him to withdraw the nomination?"
2016-04-14 00:00:00,blitzer," Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders you can now move to your lecterns while I explain a few ground rules. As moderator I'll guide the discussion asking questions and follow-ups. You'll also get questions from Dana Bash and Errol Louis. You'll each have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions 30 seconds for follow- ups. Timing lights will signal when your time is up. Both candidates have agreed to these rules now. Opening statements you'll each have two minutes. Let's begin with Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton? Thank you Secretary. We are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised. I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee.Senator Sanders in the last week you've raised questions about Secretary Clinton's qualifications to be president. You said that something is clearly lacking in terms of her judgment and you accused her of having a credibility gap.So let me ask you do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president? Secretary Clinton? Senator... Madam Secretary let him finish. Thank you. Thank you Senator. Secretary? Thank Secretary. We're going to continue on this but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning. Thank you. Senator... Senator... Senator when are you when are you you've been asked for weeks and weeks to release your tax returns. Which one? 2014? What about 2013 all the other ones? So Senator just to be clear tomorrow you will release the 2014 tax returns from you and your family? And what about the earlier ones? What's the problem... What's taking so long? Because you just have to go to the filing cabinet make a copy and release them. Thank you. Senator Senator you've slammed companies like General Electric and Verizon for moving jobs outside of the United States. Yesterday the CEO of Verizon called your views contemptable and said in your home state of Vermont Verizon has invested more than $16 million and pays millions of dollars a year to local businesses. He says you are quote ""uninformed on this issue"" and disconnected from reality. Given your obvious contempt for large American corporations how would you as president of the United States be able to effectively promote American businesses around the world? All right. Senator but the question was the question was given your contempt for large American corporations as president how would you be able to promote American business around the world? But Senator experts say that no matter the means to bring back these jobs to the United States prices of goods for consumers in the United States would go up which would disproportionately impact the poor and middle class. So how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to America's middle class and poor? Thank you. Secretary... ...Secretary Clinton? Senator... Thank you. Senator how do you... I'll have you respond in a moment. Stand by. Secretary Clinton... You will respond in a moment but I have to follow-up with Secretary Clinton.You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York's minimum wage to $15 an hour. But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.As president... ...if a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk would you sign it? Thank you. Secretary Senator please. Secretary the viewers... If you're both screaming at each other the viewers won't be able to hear either of you. So please... ...don't talk over each other. Go ahead. Go ahead Secretary. Secretary? Secretary go ahead. All right. Secretary? Senator go ahead. Thank you Senator. Thank you. We're going to turn to another critically important issue right now guns in America. Secretary Clinton you've said that Vermont Senator Sanders' home state has quote ""the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York."" But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont. Are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New York's gun violence? ...Thank you... Senator? I asked her are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New York's gun violence. She said no. But go ahead. Please go ahead sir. Thank you Senator. Thank you. Secretary Clinton I want you to respond to that but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of by guns in New York? Senator I want you to respond but I also want you to respond to this. You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages. The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting says you owe her and families an apology. Do you? So Senator do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology? Thank you. Thank you Secretary. Senator go ahead. Thank you Senator. Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News. Thank you Senator. Thank you Senator. Thank you Secretary. We have to take a quick commercial break. We have a lot more questions for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders right after this. Welcome back. Let's turn to another critically important issue.Senator Secretary the issue of energy and the environment.Secretary Clinton Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. You say you're sick and tired of him lying about your record.What are his lies? Thank you. We're going to get to that to but I want you to respond Senator. .... Thank you... Secretary Clinton go ahead and respond. ... Thank you... ... Go ahead Senator... Thank you. ... Secretary Clinton... ... Go ahead and respond. Thank you Secretary. We'll continue on this. Errol Errol Louis go ahead with your question. We're going to continue on this. Errol go ahead. Thank you. Thank you Senator. Let's turn to another critically important issue... ...the issue of national security and foreign policy.Secretary Clinton President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed. You were his secretary of State.Aren't you also responsible for that? Thank you. Senator go ahead. Yes. Secretary we're going to let you respond. Senator go ahead. Senator let her respond to that then we'll get to that. Go ahead Secretary. Thank you Secretary. Go ahead Senator. Staying on national security Dana Bash has a question. Thank you Secretary. Senator let's talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel. Senator Sanders you maintained that Israel's response in Gaza in 2014 was quote ""disproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life."" What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit? ... Thank you Senator... Thank you. Secretary Clinton do you agree with Senator Sanders that Israel overreacts to Palestinians attacks and that in order for there to be peace between Israel and the Palestinians Israel must quote end its disproportionate responses? ... Thank you... Thank you Senator go ahead go ahead Senator. Thank you Secretary. Senator. A final word Senator go ahead. Secretary. Senator go ahead. Thank you Senator. Thank you Secretary. We have to take another quick quick break. But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn New York. That is coming up right after this. Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate. We're here in Brooklyn. Secretary Senator both of you talk about major reforms to college tuition health care and Social Security all of which will take significant changes from Congress currently controlled by Republicans. Senator Sanders you're promising health care and free college for all and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and even after massive tax increases that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt. How is this fiscally responsible? Thank you Senator. Secretary go ahead and respond. Thank you Secretary. Senator go ahead. Thank you. Secretary please. Thank you Senator. Secretary Clinton Secretary Clinton go ahead. Thank you Secretary. Secretary let's talk about Social Security another critically important issue. Senator Sanders has challenged you to give a clear answer when it comes to extending the life of Social Security and expanding benefits. Are you prepared to lift the cap on taxable income which currently stands at $118500? Yes or no would you lift the cap? Thank you Secretary. Senator? Go ahead Senator. Go ahead Senator. Thank you Secretary. Senator go ahead. Thank you. Errol Errol Louis go ahead. Errol... Errol hold on a second. Go ahead. Hold on Errol... ...Errol. Hold on. Go ahead Senator. Thank you. Well thank you... Errol go ahead. Secretary Clinton go ahead. Senator go ahead. Thank you Senator. Thank you Senator very much. The candidates they will make their final pitches to New York voters right after this. Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate. It's time for the candidates' closing statements. Each candidate will have two minutes. Senator Sanders you're first. Secretary Clinton? Secretary Clinton?"

2016-04-14 00:00:00,audience member, Free Palestine!
2016-04-14 00:00:00,bash," Secretary Clint the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis. This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans. So as president would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks? Something that the law not only allows but actually explicitly encourages? ... Thank you Secretary. Senator Sanders you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up. You said quote ""That's their decision."" Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves? when you said the whole business model was fraudulent? But Senator... But Senator you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks but why allow the banks to do it themselves? Thank you Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street. Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received? Thank you Madam Secretary. Thank you. Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton if I may Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs. So I'd like to ask you so you've said that you don't want to release the transcripts until everybody does it but if there's nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters' minds why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed? Madam Secretary... Senator Sanders one second please. Secretary Clinton the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs. Why not release them? Secretary Clinton we're going to get to the tax returns later but just to put a button on this you're running now for the Democratic nomination. And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts. It's not about the Republicans... Senator Sanders in 1997 you said this about NATO you said quote: ""It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO."" Do you still feel that way? And just following up Senator Sanders Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share. So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his? Secretary Clinton? But Madam Secretary... That's going to be part of my my question to you is to that point there are 28 countries in the alliance and the United States gives more money to NATO's budget than 21 of those countries combined. If they don't agree to pay more as you suggested then what would you do as commander-in-chief? Senator Sanders your response. Thank you Senator. Senator Sanders you've spoken a lot tonight about your votes in Congress. You have been in Congress for over a quarter of the century and there as an independent not a Democrat. Now you're seeking the Democratic nomination but Secretary Clinton has suggested that she's not even sure you are a Democrat. Are you? Senator Sanders... Senator Sanders. On that very subject on that very subject Secretary Clinton mentions electing a Democratic congress several times. She says that she raised $15 million for the Democratic party in the first three months of this year. You don't appear to have raised any money for the party. Yesterday you did announce that you will help three members of Congress who have endorsed you. Why aren't you doing more to help the party you say you want to lead? ... Thank you Senator. ... Senator your time is up... Thank you Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton. Thank you Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders. ... Secretary Clinton thank you. ... Secretary Clinton... ...Secretary Clinton you're out of time... ...Senator Sanders on that note.... ... Senator Sanders I want to ask you a question about this and you can incorporate that into your response. Three months now between now and the Democratic convention. Your campaign manager says that you will absolutely take the fight to the floor if neither you nor Secretary Clinton clinches the nomination with pledged delegates alone. Do you vow to take this fight to Philadelphia no matter what?"
2015-08-06 00:00:00,, : Is this in the rules? An objection's coming.
2015-08-06 00:00:00,carson, Well I could take issue with -- with all of those things but we don't have time. But I will say we have a debate here tonight and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that in fact the thing that is probably most important is having a brain and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly. So you know experience comes from a large number of different arenas and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility hard work creativity innovation and that's what will get us on the right track now as well. Well thank you Megyn I wasn't sure I was going to get to talk again. Alright. You know what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business and I wouldn't necessarily be broadcasting what we're going to do. We. . .uh. . .we've gotten into this -- this mindset of fighting politically correct wars. There is no such thing as a politically correct war. And the left of course will say Carson doesn't believe in the Geneva Convention. Carson doesn't believe in fighting stupid wars. And -- and what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars. And I've talked to a lot of the generals a lot of our advanced people. And believe me if we gave them the mission which is what the commander-in-chief does they would be able to carry it out. And if we don't tie their hands behind their back they will do it... ...extremely effectively.
2015-08-06 00:00:00,baier," Less than a year from now in this very arena one of these 10 candidates or one of the seven on the previous debate tonight will accept the Republican party's nomination. Tonight's candidates were selected based on an average of five national polls. Just a few hours ago you heard from the candidates ranked 11th through 17. And now the prime-time event the top 10. Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson. Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Florida Senator Marco Rubio. It might be. It might be. We'll see. It might be. The rules for tonight are simple. One minute for answers 30 seconds for follow-ups. And if a candidate runs over you'll hear this. Pleasant no? We also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers as I mentioned. And while we expect them... ... we expect them to be enthusiastic as you heard we don't want to take anything away from the valuable time for the candidate. So we're looking for somewhere between a reaction to a LeBron James dunk and the Cleveland Public Library across the street. Somewhere there we'll find a balance tonight. Without further ado let's begin. Gentlemen we know how much you love hand-raising questions. So we promise this is the only one tonight: the only one. Is there anyone on stage and can I see hands who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person. Again we're looking for you to raise your hand now -- raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight. Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump to be clear you're standing on a Republican primary debate stage. The place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod. And that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton. You can't say tonight that you can make that pledge? So tonight you can't say if another one of these... OK. Dr. Paul. OK. Just to be clear you can't make a -- we're gonna -- we're going to move on. You're not gonna make the pledge tonight? OK. Alright. Governor Bush you have insisted that you're your own man. You say you have a life experience uniquely your own. Not your father's not your brother's. But there are several opponents on this stage who get big- applause lines in early voting states with this line: quote ""the last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office."" So do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics? Governor Christie you're not exactly the darling of conservatives. You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state. On Facebook the most people talking about you not surprisingly come from your state of New Jersey and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy. This -- this may be why. Under your watch New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades. The state's 44th in private sector growth. You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country. So why should voters believe that your management of the country's finances would be any different? Senator Paul you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks. You later said that that statement you could have said it better. But the statement went on and you said quote ""Everything they've talked about in foreign policy they've been wrong for the last 20 years."" Why are you so quick to blame your own party? Gentlemen the next series of questions deals with ObamaCare and the role of the federal government. Mr. Trump ObamaCare is one of the things you call a disaster. Saying it needs to be repealed and replaced. Now 15 years ago you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system a Canadian-style system. Why were you for that then and why aren't you for it now? But on ObamaCare... Mr. Trump hold up one second. All right now hold on Senator Paul... OK. All right let me... Mr. Trump it's not just your past support for single- payer health care. You've also supported a host of other liberal policies. Use -- you've also donated to several Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton included Nancy Pelosi. You explained away those donations saying you did that to get business-related favors. And you said recently quote ""When you give they do whatever the hell you want them to do."" So what specifically did... -- they do?"
2015-08-06 00:00:00,trump, I fully understand. I fully understand. I cannot say. I have to respect the person that if it's not me the person that wins if I do win and I'm leading by quite a bit that's what I want to do. I can totally make that pledge. If I'm the nominee I will pledge I will not run as an independent. But -- and I am discussing it with everybody but I'm you know talking about a lot of leverage. We want to win and we will win. But I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee. Well I've given him plenty of money. I will not make the pledge at this time. Only Rosie O'Donnell. Thank you. Yes I'm sure it was. I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. I've been challenged by so many people and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you this country doesn't have time either. This country is in big trouble. We don't win anymore. We lose to China. We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody. And frankly what I say and oftentimes it's fun it's kidding. We have a good time. What I say is what I say. And honestly Megyn if you don't like it I'm sorry. I've been very nice to you although I could probably maybe not be based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn't do that. But you know what we -- we need strength we need energy we need quickness and we need brain in this country to turn it around. That I can tell you right now. So if it weren't for me you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration Chris. You wouldn't even be talking about it. This was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement. And I said Mexico is sending. Except the reporters because they're a very dishonest lot generally speaking in the world of politics they didn't cover my statement the way I said it. The fact is since then many killings murders crime drugs pouring across the border are money going out and the drugs coming in. And I said we need to build a wall and it has to be built quickly. And I don't mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally. But we need Jeb to build a wall we need to keep illegals out. Border Patrol I was at the border last week. Border Patrol people that I deal with that I talk to they say this is what's happening. Because our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid. And the Mexican government is much smarter much sharper much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them. They don't want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them? And that's what is happening whether you like it or not. A complete disaster yes. Correct. First of all I'd like to just go back to one. In July of 2004 I came out strongly against the war with Iraq because it was going to destabilize the Middle East. And I'm the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it. And that's exactly what happened. And the Middle East became totally destabilized. So I just want to say. As far as single payer it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age which is the age you're talking about here. What I'd like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state. I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees. And if I'm negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California I have like one bidder. Nobody can bid. You know why? Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians of course with the exception of the politicians on this stage. But they have total control of the politicians. They're making a fortune. Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have... ...yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can't take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system. I'm not -- I'm not are -- I don't think you heard me. You're having a hard time tonight. You'd better believe it. If I ask them if I need them you know most of the people on this stage I've given to just so you understand a lot of money.
2015-08-06 00:00:00,wallace," Also of note Fox News is partnering for tonight's debate with Facebook. For the past several weeks we've been asking you for questions for the candidates on Facebook. Nearly 6 million of you 6 million viewed the debate videos on our site and more than 40000 of you submitted questions: some of which you will hear us asking the candidates tonight. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. And your very own governor of Ohio... ... John Kasich. Brett -- Brett I think you would call that a home field advantage. Senator Rubio when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency he said this: ""There's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor no blending into the legislative crowd."" Could you please address Governor Bush across the stage here and explain to him why you someone who has never held executive office are better prepared to be president than he is a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years. Senator Cruz your colleague Senator Paul right there next to you said a few months ago he agrees with you on a number of issues but he says you do nothing to grow the party. He says you feed red meat to the base but you don't reach out to minorities. You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress. You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently. How can you win in 2016 when you're such a divisive figure? Governor Huckabee like Governor Walker you have staked out strong positions on social issues. You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage. You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions except for the life of the mother. Millions of people in this country agree with you but according to the polls and again this an electability question according to the polls more people don't so how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016? Gentlemen we're turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about and that is the issue of immigration. Governor Bush you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration focusing on enforcement which some suggest is your effort to show that you're not soft on that issue. I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants. And here's what you said. ""They broke the law but it's not a felony it's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family."" Do you stand by that statement and do you stand by your support for earned legal status? Thank you sir. Mr. Trump it has not escaped anybody's notice that you say that the Mexican government the Mexican government is sending criminals -- rapists drug dealers across the border. Governor Bush has called those remarks quote ""extraordinarily ugly."" I'd like you -- you're right next to him -- tell us -- talk to him directly and say how you respond to that and -- and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this but you have evidence you have refused or declined to share. Why not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people? Mr. Trump I'll give you 30 seconds -- I'll give you 30 seconds to answer my question which was what evidence do you have specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border? Thirty seconds. All right. Obviously there's a lot more to talk about this. We're going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration plus other key topics including your questions on Facebook. Welcome back to FOX News/Facebook Republican Debate Night. We're going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration. We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there. So let's continue the conversation. Governor Kasich I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump. But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said. When you say that the American government is stupid that the Mexican government is sending criminals that we're being bamboozled is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration? Respectfully can we talk about illegal immigration? All right well Senator Rubio let me see if I can do better with you. Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid their leaders are smart and all of these illegals coming over are criminals? Governor Walker. Governor Walker from 2002 until as recently as 2013 just two years ago you supported comprehensive immigration reform including a path to citizenship. Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn't really thought about and that you've changed your mind. Other than politics could you explain why in the last two years you've changed your position on a path to citizenship and are there other past positions that we shouldn't hold you to? Senator Cruz some 1400 people submitted questions on this very hot topic of illegal immigration on Facebook and a number of them were about the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco allegedly shot down by an illegal. Doug Bettencourt sent this question ""will you support Kate Steinle's Law"" which would impose a mandatory five-year prison term for an illegal who is deported and then returns to this country? ""And will you defund sanctuary cities for violating federal law?"""
2015-08-06 00:00:00,question, : My question is how would the candidates stop the treacherous actions of ISIS -- ISIL and its growing influence in the U.S. if they were to become president?
2015-08-06 00:00:00,rubio, Well thank you for the question Chris and it's great to be here tonight. Let me begin by saying this: I'm not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate. I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It's important to be qualified but if this election is a resume competition then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight. Here's what this election better be about: This election better be about the future not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today not simply the issues we once faced. This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know the largest retailer in the country and the world today Amazon doesn't even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people's lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class they either don't pay enough or they are gone and we need someone that understands that as our nominee. If I'm our nominee how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she -- how is she gonna lecture me -- how is she gonna lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100000 just four years ago. If I'm our nominee we will be the party of the future. Let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The first is the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala El Salvador Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority. I also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence we have to be able to deal with that too. And that's why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States and people feel like we're being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity we're being taken advantage of. And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they've paid their fees and they hired a lawyer and they can't get in. And they're wondering maybe they should come illegally. And so these are important issues and we should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years like we have for the last 30 years. Not me.
2015-08-06 00:00:00,christie," If you think it's bad now you should've seen it when I got there. The fact is -- the fact is in the eight years before I became governor taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became governor spending was increased 56 percent. And in the eight years before I become governor taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became Governor spending was increased 56 percent and in the eight years before I became governor there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey. Zero. For eight years. So what did we do? We came in we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget. We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases. In fact we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor. We cut business taxes $2.3 billion and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place. And what's happened since? A hundred ninety-two thousand private sector jobs in the five and a half years I've been governor. We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey but I am darn proud we've brought our state back. Yes I do. And I'll tell you why: because I'm the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the Patriot Act who has gone before the federal -- the Foreign Intelligence Service court who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after September 11th. I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th 2001 and the world changed enormously the next day and that happened in my state. This is not theoretical to me. I went to the funerals. We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day. My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day at her office having gone through it that morning. When you actually have to be responsible for doing this you can do it and we did it for seven years in my office respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland. And I will make no apologies ever for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people. We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that not fewer and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way. As president that is exactly what I'll do. And -- and Megyn? Megyn that's a -- that you know that's a completely ridiculous answer. ""I want to collect more records from terrorists but less records from other people."" How are you supposed to know Megyn? What are you supposed to... ...how are you supposed to -- no I'll tell you how you look... Let me tell you something you go... When you -- you know senator... Listen senator you know when you're sitting in a subcommittee just blowing hot air about this you can say things like that. When you're responsible for protecting the lives of the American people then what you need to do is to make sure... ...is to make sure that you use the system the way it's supposed to work. There is no... And you know -- you know Senator Paul? Senator Paul you know the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th. Those are the hugs I remember and those had nothing to do -- and those had nothing to do with politics unlike what you're doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the Senate then putting them on the Internet within half an hour to raise money for your campaign... ...and while still putting our country at risk. You know what Megyn can I..."
2015-08-06 00:00:00,huckabee, Chris I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment. That's a long and difficult process. I've actually taken the position that's bolder than that. A lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood as if that's a huge game changer. I think it's time to do something even more bold. I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother's womb is a person at the moment of conception. The reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on. And this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child's Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law. It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they're parts to a Buick.
2015-08-06 00:00:00,unidentified male, What will be your plan on making immigration easier for those that want to do it legally? What specific steps would you take to contain the growth of ISIS? That's true.
2015-08-06 00:00:00,bush, Absolutely I do and I'm gonna run hard run with heart and run to win. I'm gonna have to earn this. Maybe the barrier -- the bar's even higher for me. That's fine. I've got a record in Florida. I'm proud of my dad and I'm certainly proud of my brother. In Florida they called me Jeb because I earned it. I cut taxes every year totaling $19 billion. We were -- we had -- we balanced every budget. We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves. We were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. They keep -- they called me Veto Corleone. Because I vetoed 2500 separate line-items in the budget. I am my own man. I governed as a conservative and I govern effectively. And the net effect was during my eight years 1.3 million jobs were created. We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way and people rose up. I do. I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family. But we need to control our border. It's not -- it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. So I -- I've written a book about this and yet this week I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that -- that really mirrored what we said in the book which is that we need to deal with E-Verify we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay. We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement border security. We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It is ridiculous and tragic... ...that people are dying because of the fact that -- that local governments are not following the federal law. There's much to do. And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue which Barack Obama has done now for six long years the next president -- and I hope to be that president -- will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth. And there should be a path to earned legal status... ... for those that are here. Not -- not amnesty earned legal status which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time. ...I remember... ...I remember Megyn. Knowing what we know now with faulty intelligence and not having security be the first priority when -- when we invaded it was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone in however for the people that did lose their lives and the families that suffer because of it -- I know this full well because as governor of the state of Florida I called every one of them. Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them that I cared about them and it was really hard to do. And every one of them said that their child did not die in vain or their wife of their husband did not die in vain. So why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that. Here's the lesson that we should take from this which relates to this whole subject. Barack Obama became president and he abandoned Iraq. He left and when he left Al Qaida was done for. ISIS was created because of the void that we left and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana. To honor the people that died we need to -- we need to --- stop the -- Iran agreement for sure because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal.
2015-08-06 00:00:00,cruz," Chris I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth. If you're looking for someone to go to Washington to go along to get along to get -- to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests then I ain't your guy. There is a reason... .... that we have $18 trillion in debt. Because as conservatives as Republicans we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House we've got a Republican Senate and we don't have leaders who honor their commitments. I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do. Chris absolutely yes. And not only will I support it... ...I have authored Kate's law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation. I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate's law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate's law. You know there was reference made to our leaders being stupid. It's not a question of stupidity. It's that they don't want to enforce the immigration laws. That there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty. President Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country. There's 7 billion people across the face of the globe many of whom want to come to this country. If they come legally great. But if they come illegally and they get amnesty that is how we fundamentally change this country and it really is striking. A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer's gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate. Megyn we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words ""radical Islamic terrorism"". When I asked General Dempsey the chairman of the joint chiefs what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS he said there is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization. That with all due respect is nonsense. It's the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs. What we need is a commander in chief who makes -- clear if you join ISIS if you wage jihad on America then you are signing your death warrant. Megyn of course it's an ideological problem that's one of the reasons I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don't use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans. Yes it is ideological and let me contrast President Obama who at the prayer breakfast essentially acted as an apologist. He said ""Well gosh the crusades the inquisitions--"" We need a president that shows the courage that Egypt's President al-Sisi did a Muslim when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world."
2015-08-06 00:00:00,kasich, Well first of all... ... first of all Megyn you should know that -- that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times. Secondly I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what? To treat the mentally ill. Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons. It costs $22500 a year... ... to keep them in prison. I'd rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life. Secondly we are rehabbing the drug-addicted. Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems. We now treat them in the prisons release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is -- is threatening their very families. So we're treating them and getting them on their feet. And finally the working poor instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more where they're sicker and we end up paying we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet. And do you know what? Everybody has a right to their God-given purpose. And finally our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country. And finally we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black. We've cut $5 billion in taxes... ...and we've grown 350000 jobs. Chris first of all I was just saying to Chris Christie they say we're outspoken we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're really going to learn it. Here is the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He's hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They're fed up. They don't think the government is working for them. And for people who want to just tune him out they're making a mistake. Now he's got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know look I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hasn't been done since. I was a military reformer. I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350000 jobs. But the point is that we all have solutions. Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see it and we all do. But we all have different ways of getting there. And you're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are.
2015-08-06 00:00:00,walker, Well I'm pro-life I've always been pro-life and I've got a position that I think is consistent with many Americans out there in that... ...in that I believe that that is an unborn child that's in need of protection out there and I've said many a time that that unborn child can be protected and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother. That's been consistently proven. Unlike Hillary Clinton who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago long before any of these videos came out... ...I've got a position that's in line with everyday America. Chris I actually said that on your show earlier this year. I acknowledged that. I said I actually listened to the American people. And I think people across America want a leader who's actually going to listen to them. I talked to border state governors and other elected officials. I look at how this president particularly through last November messed up the immigration system in this country. Most importantly I listened to the people of America. I believe we need to secure the border. I've been to the border with Governor Abbott in Texas and others seeing the problems that they have there. There is international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders and we need to do something about it. Secure the border enforce the law no amnesty and go forward with the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages. I don't know about additional ones. We need to focus on the ones we have. You look at Egypt probably the best relationship we've had in Israel at least in my lifetime incredibly important. You look at the Saudis -- in fact earlier this year I met with Saudi leaders and leaders from the United Arab Emirates and I asked them what's the greatest challenge in the world today? Set aside the Iran deal. They said it's the disengagement of America. We are leading from behind under the Obama-Clinton doctrine -- America's a great country. We need to stand up and start leading again and we need to have allies not just in Israel but throughout the Persian Gulf.
2015-08-06 00:00:00,kelly," Welcome to the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign live from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland Ohio. I'm Megyn Kelly... ... along with my co-moderators Brett Baier and Chris Wallace. Tonight... Nice. Tonight thousands of people here in the Q along with millions of voters at home will get their very first chance to see the candidates face off in a debate answering the questions you want answered. As for the candidates who will be answering those questions? Here they are. Positioned on the stage by how they stand in the polls in the center of the stage tonight businessman Donald Trump. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. Gentlemen our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election and we start tonight with you Dr. Carson. You are a successful neurosurgeon but you admit that you have had to study up on foreign policy saying there's a lot to learn. Your critics say that your inexperience shows. You've suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel and domestically you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair. Aren't these basic mistakes and don't they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be president? Mr. Trump one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter. However that is not without its downsides in particular when it comes to women. You've called women you don't like ""fat pigs dogs slobs and disgusting animals."" Your Twitter account... No it wasn't. Your Twitter account... For the record it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell. Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks. You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton who was likely to be the Democratic nominee that you are part of the war on women? Governor Walker you've consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape incest or to save the life of the mother. You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother's life but you're on the record as having objected to it. Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election? Governor Kasich You chose to expand Medicaid in your state unlike several other governors on this stage tonight and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months. You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven Saint Peter isn't going to ask them how small they've kept government but what they have done for the poor. Why should Republican voters who generally want to shrink government believe that you won't use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program? Alright gentlemen we're gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security. Governor Christie. You've said that Senator Paul's opposition to the NSA's collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack. Do you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing the bulk collection of people's phone records in the event of a terrorist attack? Go ahead sir. Governor Christie make your point. Go ahead governor. Alright. Alright we've gotta cut it off there. We have plenty more we want to get to. That was an interesting exchange thank you for that. Well I want to move on because I have -- we're gonna get to you governor but I -- I really wanna get to a Facebook questioner. His name is Alex Chalgren and he has the following question: Senator Cruz I wanna talk to you about this because many of the Facebook users and -- and -- the -- the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight. You asked the chairman of the joint chiefs a question: ""What would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days?"" He told you ""IISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide."" And then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis. How would you destroy ISIS in 90 days? You don't see it as... ...an ideological problem -- an ideological problem in addition to a military one? Governor Bush for days on end in this campaign you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now... ...we would've invaded Iraq... I remember it too and ISIS of course is now thriving there. You finally said ""No."" To the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated a country and deposed a ruthless dictator how do you look at them now and say that your brothers war was a mistake? Governor Walker in February you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world. Which Arab country not already in the U.S. led coalition has potential to be our greatest partner? Dr. Carson in one of his first acts as commander in chief President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror. As president would you bring back water boarding? We have a lot for you don't worry. Fear not you may rue that request."
2015-08-06 00:00:00,paul, This is what's wrong! I mean this is what's wrong. He buys and sells politicians of all stripes he's already... Hey look look! He's already hedging his bet on the Clintons OK? So if he doesn't run as a Republican maybe he supports Clinton or maybe he runs as an independent... ...but I'd say that he's already hedging his bets because he's used to buying politicians. First of all only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism. Only ISIS is responsible for the depravity. But we do have to examine how are we going to defeat ISIS? I've got a proposal. I'm the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS. I've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees. It's a disgrace. We've got to stop -- we shouldn't fund our enemies for goodness sakes. So we didn't create ISIS -- ISIS created themselves but we will stop them and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them and not arming them. Megyn may I respond? May I respond? I want to collect more records from terrorists but less records from innocent Americans. The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over! John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights. Use the Fourth Amendment! Use the Fourth Amendment! Get a warrant! Get a judge to sign the warrant! See here's the problem. Here's the problem governor. Here's the problem governor. You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights. Every time you did a case you got a warrant from a judge. I'm talking about searches without warrants... ...indiscriminately of all Americans' records and that's what I fought to end. I don't trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug and if you want to give him a big hug again go right ahead. I've got a news flash... News flash the Republican Party's been fighting against a single-payer system... -- for a decade. So I think you're on the wrong side of this if you're still arguing for a single-payer system.
2015-08-06 00:00:00,unidentified female, I'd like to know what the candidates are going to do so that I feel safe in my own country again.
2015-08-06 00:00:00,moderators, Bret Baier (Fox News); Megyn Kelly (Fox News); and Chris Wallace (Fox News)
2016-02-04 00:00:00,sanders," Rachel thank you very much. Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.They are working longer hours for low wages. They're worried about the future of their kids and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Not what America is supposed to be about. Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about. And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy where billionaire Wall Street corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.Our job together is to end a rigged economy create an economy that works for all and absolutely overturn Citizens United. One person one vote. That's what American democracy is about. Well I haven't quite run for president before. Let's deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made. And by the way you know sometimes there's a lot of drama here. I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.Here is the issue. Every major country on earth whether it's the U.K. whether it's France whether it's Canada has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are. So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can't do that.I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can't stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.Number two in the economy today everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce. This is 2016. When we talk about public education it can no longer be K through 12th grade. I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free. Well how do we pay for that? It's an expensive proposition.I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country which is crushing millions of people. We pay for it in my view by a tax on Wall Street speculation. The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class. Let me... ... this is a good discussion here. And let me just say this. As Secretary Clinton may know I am on the Health Education Labor Committee. That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we're waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate. The Affordable Care Act has clearly as Secretary Clinton made the point done a lot of good things but what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall. So I do believe that in the future not by dismantling what we have hereI helped write that billbut by moving forward rallying the American people I do believe we should have health care for all. No not at all. Here's the reality of American economic life today. The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process. The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent. The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people's needs and desires from what Congress is doing. So to my mind what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process stand up and fight back demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contributioncontributors. Now all of the ideas that I'm talking about they are not radical ideas. Making public colleges and universities tuition free that exists in countries all over the world used to exist in the United States. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. That is not a radical idea.What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests and the campaign contributors. When we do that we can in fact transform America. Let me just pick up on this point. This whole discussion began because I commented not making overall evaluation about the Secretary. She was in Ohio I think in September or November and she got up and said something like I have beenI'm paraphrasing I have been criticized because people think I'm a moderate. Well I am a moderate. That's where this came from. It wasn't me paraphrasing her. It is what she said and all that I said was there's nothing wrong with being a moderate. But you can't be a moderate you can't a progressive.In terms of President Obama I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago 800000 jobs being lost every month $1.4 trillion dollar deficit. The world's financial system on the verge of collapse. I think that President Obama Vice President Biden and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job. We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. That's the fact but we still have a very long way to go.Do I think President Obama is a progressive? Yes I do. I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement. But yes I think he has done an excellent job. That's right I mean instead of arguing about definitions let's talk about... ... What we should do and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC who's not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street... ... And special interests. I am enormously proud. Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions averaging $27 dollars a piece. That is what the political revolution means. Well Rachel actually that wasn't accurate. In 1988 the Republican did win I believe by 3 points. I came in second. It was 34-31 I think 19 for the Democrat. In that race the Democrat was the spoiler not me. And it is true... ...it is true it's not to be denied I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent. That is true. But on the other hand I havewhen I was in the House for 16 years I caucused with the Democrats. In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats of course. And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago which I'm very proud of. And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.I am running for president as a Democrat. And if elected not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities but let me be frank I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesn't exist now. And you know what I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states. Well I don't see it quite like that. I amwill absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors mayors members of the House. She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her. That's a fact. I don't deny it. But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece. That we have had meetings where 25000-30000 people have come out. That our campaign is a campaign of the people by the people and for the people.So Rachel yes Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment. I represent I hope ordinary Americans and by the way who are not all that enamored with the establishment but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus. What being part of the establishment is is in the last quarter having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street that throughout one's life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests. To my mind if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families. What... ... you know... . Let's talk aboutOK let's talk... ... let us talk about issues. Let's talk about issues. Let's... ... let'slet'slet's talk about issues. Let's talklet's talk about issues all right? Let's talk about why in the 1990s Wall Street got deregulated. Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street providedspent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions? Well some people might think yeah that had some influence. Let's ask why it is that we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow and there's nothing that the government can do to stop it.You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry? Let's talk about climate change.Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?That is what goes on in America. I am notI like... ...there is a reason. You know there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system. And in my view it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country. I think as Secretary Clinton knows there is nobody who fought harder. I was on the House Financial Committee at that time. I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and RepublicansRobert Rubin Alan Greenspanabout great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge. Go to YouTube today. Look up Greenspan-Sanders. Listen to what I told them then. I helped lead the effort against deregulation. Unfortunately we lost that. The result iswas the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression. Chuck actually we looked at it but it turns out to be a disaster. The way it is structured right now if you make it all the way to California you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early statesIowa New Hampshire the other statesit just doesn't work. Your point is well taken. I believe in public funding of elections absolutely. But this system isI don't know if the secretary would agreeis currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics. But if the... but Chuck it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated. It no longer works. Nobody can become president based on that system. So what's the alternative? There are two alternatives. And you know we looked at it. Well should we do a Super PAC but I concluded honestly I don't represent Corporate America or billionaires I didn't want it. So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign. And you know what? We got 3.5 million individual contributions $27 a piece. I think that's pretty good. Let me just say this. Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country. You have companies like Goldman Sachs who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors. Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans. But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about. These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying in this case of Goldman Sachs a $5 billion fine.Kid gets caught with marijuana that kid has a police record. A Wall Street executive destroys the economy $5 billion settlement with the government no criminal record. That is what power is about. That is what corruption is about. And that is what has to change in the United States of America. I would say thatthat folks who have looked at this issue for a long time whether it's Elizabeth Warren or many other economists will tell you that right now yes we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation. And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today bigger than they weresignificantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today a good Republican by the way what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically. And that is what I believe and many economists believe. Time to break them up. Well we've had a number of economists supporting our legislation. And here's where we are. The American people can judge. Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America. That is a lot of money. They issue two thirds of the credit cards and by the way they're ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards and they write about one third of the mortgages.That is a lot of power for six financial institutions. That's it. I think it is too much power. Too much economic power too much political power and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up. Yeah I do. I agree with much of what the Secretary said but madam Secretary it is not one streak. Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power. That's a fact. And I want to say something and it may sound harsh not to you but to the American people. In a sense in my view the business model of Wall Street is fraud. It's fraud. I believe that corruption is rampant and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once if we don't start breaking them up we're going to have to bail them out again and I do not want to see that happen... Of course I can work with them but let's be clear. When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric what I was referring to is an outrage. I suspect the secretary agrees request me. Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands Bermuda and other tax havens.And in a given year Rachel after making billions of dollars in profit do you know how much they're paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year? Zero. Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes you know what we're going to do? We're going to end that loophole. They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.We're going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.Can I work with corporations? Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development? Absolutely they are. And we should be proud of them.But on the other hand there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker who have said if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America that's what I will do.I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America. OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq which created barbaric organizations like ISIS. Not only did I vote against that war I helped lead the opposition and if you go to my website berniesanders.com you will see the statement that I made in 2002. And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown in fact did happen. Well I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq. And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesn't happen. I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happenand let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said. I think he hit the nail on the head.And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam. And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS with the support of a coalition of major powersU.S. U.K. France Germany and Russia.So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate. But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say ""Look we're taking on those terrible Americans.""The combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support. We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. Well you can't simply withdraw tomorrow. Wish we could and allow you know the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country. But what we must do and what we have seen in recent months is some progress in Iraq where finally the Iraqi army which has not been a particularly effective fighting force retook Ramadi. ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year. Hopefully and you know one can't predict the future that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS. Well that's not quite accurate. I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy. Maybe I shouldn't have combined the two in the same speech because the foreign policy part of it didn't get much attention. So let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue. I think while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq. And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president is the United States cannot do it alone. We cannot be the policeman of the world. We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense. We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition. I fully fully concede that Secretary Clinton who was secretary of State for four years has more experiencehat is not arguablein foreign affairs. But experience is not the only point judgment is. And once again back in 2002 when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq one of us voted the right way and one of us didn't. In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia of course they hate each other. That's no great secret. But John Kerry who is I think doing a very good job has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS. Well... Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow? I never said that. I think we should move forward as quickly as we can. And you're right. They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that. But you know a number of years ago people were saying normal relationship with Cuba what a bad and silly idea. They're Communists they are our enemy. Well guess what? Change has come.So please don't suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow. We don't. But I would like to see us move forward and hopefully some day that will happen. And I would say if I might Madam Secretaryand you can correct me if I'm wrong. When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies. I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with. OK. I think President Obama had the right idea and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions. But of course it doesn't do us any good to not talk with our adversaries... Just to set the record straight I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. ... ISIS... ISIS you forgot one... ... No no... ... ISIS would be ... Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators or maybe just one who seems to be somewhat paranoid. And who had nuclear weapons. And our goal there in my view is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure. China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China. I worry very much about an isolated paranoid country with atomic bombs.I think clearly we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine. ... No I don't. I worry very very much about an isolated country. That's what makes me nervous. Russia lives in the world. China lives in the world. North Korea is a very very strange country because it is so isolated and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons they have got to be dealt with. Dealt with effectively. Let me agree. You know as the secretary knows I chairedI had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. And it is interesting to me you know Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans. I work with the American Legion the VFW the DAV the Vietnam Vets and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America. That's what I did. And I brought it to the floor of the Senate. Every Democrat voted for it I got two Republicans. We ended up with 56 votes and I couldn't get the 60 votes that I needed. That is pathetic.This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.So Republicans talk a good game about veterans but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans frankly they were not there.What I did next Rachel is I had to retreat a little bit I had to compromise. I did work with John McCain. I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House. And we put together not the bill that I wanted but probably the most comprehensive V.A. health care bill in the modern history of this country.Secretary Clinton is absolutely right there are people Koch brothers among others who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America funded by the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers by the way want to destroy Social Security Medicare Medicaid every governmental program passed since the 1930s. Yes there are people out there who want to privatize it.The last point that I'd make. I had a hearing. I had all of the veterans groups in front of me. And I said to them tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A. understanding there are waiting lines and real problems when a veteran gets into the system is the quality of care good?Without exception what they said good excellent very good. We've got to strengthen the V.A. We do not privatize the V.A. Well I agree with the Des Moines Register but let's not blow this out of proportion. This is not athis is not like a winner-take-all thing. I think where we now standcorrect me if I'm wrongyou have 22 delegates I have 20 delegates. We need 2500 delegates to win the nomination. You know so this is notthis is not the biggest deal in the world. We think by the way based on talking to our precinct captains we may have at least two more delegates.What the Des Moines Register saidyou know there were coinI think there were half a dozen coin flipsa fairly chaotic type situation. At the end of the day no matter how it's recounted it will break roughly even.And by the way I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa. See and I don't have to say it because they voted already. And I love New Hampshire too because you haven't voted but... ...but look I think people are blowing this up out of proportion. But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined. Oh . See when you are old then they go back all these years. All right. What have you got? Well you know a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. But let me just say this. In terms of where we are right now as you mention Rachel in a number of national and state including New Hampshire. For example the last poll I sawthere may have been a new onelast one I saw here in New Hampshire a battleground state had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin. These are polls. Polls go up. Polls go down. But here's why I think I will be if nominated the strongest candidate. Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout which by the way is why they love voter suppression. I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people from young people who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.If there is a large voter turnout not only do we retain the White House but I think we regain the Senate. We win governors' chairs up and down the line. So I believe if you want to retain the White House if you want to see Democrats do well across the board I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.  I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate. There's a process under way. I will not politicize it. And by the wayand by the way if I may the secretary probably doesn't know that there's not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that. Not losing control of our campaign. You know we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable and we have apologized and dealt with that. In terms of the last one as I understand it we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates and to the best of my knowledge that is what we did. So we never said never said that somebody a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper. But that was only forthat was not to be on television. That's an important point. That was just somethingas the secretary knows you put titles on ads and you send them out but there was no word in that ad none that said that those newspapers had endorsed us. ... Look I hear what the Secretary said and I understand but look there areall of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible horrible crimes. It's hard to imagine how people can do bomb and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City or do the Boston Marathon bombing but this is what I believe and for a couple of reasons. Number one too many innocent people including minorities African Americans have been executed when they were not guilty. That's number one. We have to be very careful about making sure about that.But second of all and maybe in a deeper reason of course there are barbaric acts out there. But in a world of so much violence and killing I just don't believe that government itself should be part of the killing. So when somebody commits... ...somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen you lock them up and you toss away the key. They're never going to get out. But I just don't' want to see government be part of killing. That's all. Absolutely. I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately. You know I don't go around asking for governor's resignations every day. In fact I think I never have in my life. But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility... ...was so outrageous.What we are talking about are children being poisoned. That's what we're talking about. We don't know no one knows for sure because they haven't done the appropriate studies but there's no question that kids' intellectual development may have been impacted. We don't know how many thousands.The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension. And when you have one of the I think significant public health crises of recent years of course the federal government comes in.And of course the federal government says you're not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.Last point on this. And I suspect the secretary agrees. One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been. Flint Michigan is a poor community. It is disproportionately African-American and minority. And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable. Absolutely right. Chuck I believe in trade but I do not believe in unfettered free trade. I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations. I was not only in opposition to NAFTAand this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements. I was not only in opposition to NAFTA I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understoodI don't think this is really rocket science.We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created. I didn't believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA CAFTA PNTR with China and the TPP is it's to say to American workers hey you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.I don't want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour. I don't want companies shutting down in America throwing people out on the street moving to China and bringing their products back into this country.So do I believe in trade? Of course I believe in trade. But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America for corporate America resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs 60000 factories in America lost since 2001 millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral a race to the bottom where employers say ""Hey you don't want to take a cut in pay? We're going to China.""Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages. Trade is one of the reasons for that. No let... ... I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows. All right? We got to do that. But you misswhen you looked at the issues you missed two of the most important. And that is you're not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform. So long as big money interests control the United States Congress it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families. So let me be very clear. No nominee of mine if I'm elected president to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United. Second pointsecond point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which today allows us to have more people in jail than any other countrylargely African-American and Latinothe only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share is when millions of people become involved in the political process.No you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell. Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying ""Mitch stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families.""And as president that's what I will work hard on. I agree with what the secretary said. We shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves. And as I have said many times you know sometimes in these campaigns things get a little bit out of hand. I happen to respect the secretary very much I hope it's mutual. And on our worst days I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate. Imy dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland. Didn't have any money couldn't speak English he died pretty young and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president. I love this country and my dad loved this country and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family even though we never had much money. But today in America we are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.I'm running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.Thank you all."
2016-02-04 00:00:00,moderators, Chuck Todd (MSNBC); Rachel Maddow (MSNBC)
2016-02-04 00:00:00,clinton," Well I'm happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate as we move toward the primary on Tuesday. I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values live up to our values in the 21st century but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed. And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind.Yes of course the economy has not been working for most Americans. Yes of course we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.But there's also the continuing challenges of racism of sexism of discrimination against the LGBT community of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.I believe that we can get back on the right track. I want to imagine a country where people's wages reflect their hard work where we have healthcare for everyone and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.I'm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes and I'm not making promises that I cannot keep. Well let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals. I've been fighting for universal healthcare for many years and we're now on the path to achieving it. I don't want us to start over again. I think that would be a great mistake to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare. I want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage. And I don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. So we have a difference.I also believe in affordable college but I don't believe in free college because every expert that I have talked to says look how will you ever control the costs. What I want to do is make sure middle class kids not Donald Trump's kids get to be able to afford college. I want to get the economy going again. It's not just enough about what we're against as important as that is. I have a plan to create new jobs manufacturing infrastructure clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power. I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.And of course I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work. But the numbers just don't add up from what Senator Sanders has been proposing. That's why all of the independent experts all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do. A progressive is someone who makes progress. That's what I intend to do. If I could just follow up on that. There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act I want to improve it. I want to build on it get the costs down get prescription drug costs down. Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again. This was a major achievement of President Obama of our country. It is helping people right now.I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding. Let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody. Well because I am a progressive who gets things done. And the root of that word progressive is progress. But I've heard Senator Sanders comments and it's really caused me to wonder who's left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Under his definition President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact. Even the late great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA. You know we have differences and honestly I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country. But if we're going to get into labels I don't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times. I don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity. I don't think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform. So we could go back and forth like this but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do. That's why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress get more jobs with rising incomes get us to universal health care coverage get us to universal pre-k paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy that will ensure Americans keep making progress. That's what I'm offering and that's what I will do as president. Well Chuck... ... If I could you know in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn't change my record of having fought for racial justice having fought for kids rights having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children's Defense Fund. It certainly didn't stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies. Before it was called HillarycareI mean before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on and we weren't successful but we kept fighting and we got the children's health insurance program. Every step along the way I have stood up and fought and have the scars to prove it.So again... ...I think it's important that look I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself. I understand that that's what you do in campaigns but at the same time let's not bein I think an unfair way making an accusation or making an attack about where I stand and about where I've always stood.It is fair to say Senator that in your definition as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism I don't know anyone else who fits that definition but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time and time again against special interests against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.And that's what we ought to be celebrating. Let's talk about what we would do as President and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future. ... Well you began it yesterday with your comments... You know the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean who is with us tonight. And I'm very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials. Two former governors the current governor the current other senator. I really appreciate that.And I think it's because they've worked with me they've seen what I do. They know what kind of a colleague I am. They want me as their partner in the White House. And that's exactly what I will do.We'll get things done together. Democrats Republicans independents we're going to make progress together when I'm president. Well look I've got to just jump in here because honestly Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the establishment. And I've got to tell you that it is... ...it is really quite amusing to me. People support me because they know me. They know my life's work. They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders. And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done. I am not going to make promises I can't keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost. A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.I'm not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes and not mean it because I don't want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead. That is not my agenda. Yeah but II think it's fair to really ask what's behind that comment. You know Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign. I've tried to keep my disagreements over issues as it should be. But time and time again by innuendo by insinuation there is this attack that he is putting forth which really comes down toyou know anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.And I just absolutely reject that Senator. And I really don't think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you. And enough is enough. If you've got something to say say it directly.But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received. And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities and I'm very proud of that. So I think it's time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out... ... in recent weeks and let's talk... ...let's talk about about the issues. Let's talk about the issues that divide us. And let'slet's... ... we both agree with campaign finance reform. II worked hard for McCain-Feingold. I want to reverse Citizens United. And solet's talk about issues. Well you know Senator I don't thinkI don't... ... I don't think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests among whom you have named a few than I. And I'm proud of that. You know when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage they went after me with a vengeance.Today you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you. I know this game. I'm going to stop this game.But while we're talking about votes you're the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000 which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.So I don't knowI'm not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives. People make mistakes and I'm certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage. What we've got to do as Democratswhat we've got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems. And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.That's what this election should be about. On the issue of Wall Street. Well you know Rachel I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record. You know I didwhen I left the secretary of State's office like so many former officials military leaders journalists others I did go on the speaking circuit. I spoke to heart doctors I spoke to the American Camping Association I spoke to auto dealers and yes I spoke to firms on Wall Street. They wanted me to talk about the world what my experience had been as secretary of State. But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash. I was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. I proposed changes in CEO compensation.I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. Hedge fund billionaires Karl Rove another billionaire jumped in.And why are they doing that? These are guys who try to make smart investments. They know my record they know me they know that I say what I believe and I will do it. And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.So I do want people to know that and I think it's important for everybody to understand I have a record I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again. If I could let me just say that of course it has to change. It has to change. And that's why I have put forward a plan to do just that. And it's been judged to be the toughest most effective and comprehensive one. I have great respect for Senator Sanders's commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall. But I do not believe that that is enough. And in fact I don't believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.You know we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks. And I've said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk. But I want to go further because it was investment banks it was insurance companies it was mortgage companies all of which contributed.So let's not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem. We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed. My plan takes us further and it would do the job. Look we have a lawlook you know II appreciate the senator's advocacy. We have a law. It was passed. It was signed by President Obama. It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed. And by the way President Obama signed that pushed it through even though he took donations from Wall Street because he's a responsible president. So we have a law in place. If the circumstances warrant it I will certainly use it. And from what you say I know you will as well.But that is not enough. And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop methe hedge fund guys the shadow banking guysis because I've got their number on all of that. And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.You know we can't just fight the last war. We've got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again to hurt the economy and to hurt so many Americans. And my plan Paul Krugman Barney Frank a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be have said I am exactly on point and the Wall Street guys actually know that. I will look into it. I don't know the status but I will certainly look into it. But I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs. I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden. My view on this is look at my record. Look at what I am proposing andwe have a vigorous agreement here. We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company and we saved the auto industry and now they want to avoid paying taxes.I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people's health. Now if all we're going to talk about is one part of our economy and indeed one streak in our economy we're missing the big oil companies. We're missing other big energy companies. We're missing the big picture and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist and I will continue to do that. ... Well Senator no one wants to see that happen. I mean look I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out who lost their homes who are barely back with their heads above water. This was a disaster for our country and we can never let that happen again. We have no disagreement about this. But I think it's a broader target list than just Wall Street and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people. And I think I have that kind of experience maybe because they've beat me up for so many years and I know exactly how to handle them because I've been in the arena with them time and time again. Well I think what the president understands and what he's trying to do is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting. I agree with the president. I've said myself we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraqthat is off the table.But we do have special forces we do have trainers we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure take out their leadership.And I think that given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond as we have sadly seen in our own country it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed to work with the Kurds to provide them the support but they're doing the fighting. We're doing the support and enabling.And I also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters foreign funding and take ISIS on online as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.So as I look at what the president it doing it adds up to me. We just have to keeptry to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back. No. I mean of course that's a theoretical question and we don't know what it would be for and we don't know how many numbers there are. I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq. I support special forces. I support trainers. I support the air campaign. And I think we're making some progress. I want to continue to intensify that and that's exactly what the president is doing. If I couldif I could... ... respectfully addlook we did differ. A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. We have to look at the threats that we face right now... ...and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them. Oh absolutely. The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan. We have a very cooperative government there with Ashraf Ghani and his tophis top partner Abdullah. And they are doing their very best. And the Afghan army is actually fighting. The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory. And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need. Because it's not just the Taliban. We now are seeing outposts of you know fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.So we've got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia and we have to pay close attention to it. And we have to build coalitions something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks. A group of national security experts military intelligence experts issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders's views on foreign policy and national security pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel. Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together when they can't stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment. So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief. And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here. Well let me just add that you know I've said this before and I'm very proud of it that when it comes to judgment having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time he turned to me to be secretary of State. And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration namely whether or not to go after bin Laden I was at that table I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do on that on Iran on Russia on China on a whole raft of issues. Because I know from my own experience that you've got to be ready on day one. There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today you know to try to just say wait I'll get to that when I can. That is just not an acceptable approach. Absolutely. You know I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions. I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians. I'm very pleased we got that nuclear agreement. It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program. We have to enforce it there have to be consequences attached to it. But that is not our only problem with Iran. We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.They are destabilizing governments in the region. They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel. A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard. I'm prepared to do that work but I believe just as I did with imposing the sanctions you have to get action for action.If we were to normalize relations right now we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior. The president doesn't think we should. I certainly don't think we should. I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us. Well Senator let me just correct the record if I can. You knowlet me correct the record. As Ias I certainly recall the question was to meet with without conditions. And you're right I was against that. I was against it then I would be against it now. Part of diplomacy the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get and giving something the other side wants. Of course you've got to try to make peace with and work with those who are your adversaries but you don't just rush in open the door and say ""Here I am. Let's talk and make a deal."" That's not the way it works. ... Well we set conditions on Iran. We worked hard to get them established and to be enforced and then we talked. That's exactly the right... ...and that's what I did with the President so he and I are on the very same page. I haven't talked to Secretary Carter but here's what I would think he's planning. We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran that's an enforcement consequence action for action follow on. We have a plan we will watch them we will be vigilant. We do have to worry about North Korea. They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability and they're working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.And I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii if not the West Coast. We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine and constrain them.But what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russia's putting on our European allies. The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe. The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another seizing territory holding it in Crimea. Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East. They have a naval base they have an air base in Syria. They want to hang on to that. I think what Secretary Carter is seeing and I'm glad he is is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense. We've got to do more to support our partners in NATO and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. The best way to do that is to put more armor in put more money from the Europeans in so they're actually contributing more to their own defense. Well first of all I'm absolutely against privatizing the V.A. And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what's wrong with the V.A. There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.But you're absolutely right you know Rachel this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda. They've actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care specialized care for our veterans.I will fight that as hard as I can. I think there's where we can enlist the veterans service organizations the veterans of America because yes let's fix the V.A. but we will never let it be privatized and that is a promise. Whatever they decide to do that's fine. All right. I can only tell you what I believe and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November. And I say that with greatwith great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running. I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign. I hope that I will be able to earn their support. They may not support me now but I support them and we'll work together.But what I'm concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states who know how hard it is to win a general election. And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight. I've been vetted. There's hardly anything you don't know about me. And I think it's fair to say that whoever is in that position Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run will face the most withering onslaught.So I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job. I think I'm the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans. And I think that at the end of the day it's not so much electability. It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe can get the economy moving again can get incomes rising can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to. And that's what I'm prepared to... Absolutely I can. You know before it was emails it was Benghazi and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that. And I testified for 11 hours answered their questions. They basically said yeah didn't get her. We tried. That was all a political ploy. Now we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts. and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice's aide they've been doing to me which is that I never sent or received any classified material. They are retroactively classifying it.I agree completely with Secretary Powell who said today this is an absurdity. And so I think the American people will know it's an absurdity. I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever. I am 100 percent confident. This is a security review that was requested. It is being carried out. It will be resolved. But I have to add if there's going to be a security review about me there's going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people including Republican office holders because we've got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications. Honest to goodness this isthis just beggars the imagination. So I have absolutely no concerns about it but we've got to get to the bottom of what's really going on here and I hope that will happen. No. Yes I do. Andyou know what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that to me is the real dividing line. I have much more confidence in the federal system and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system like terrorism. I have strong feelings about that. I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City killing 168 people including 19 children in a daycare center.I do for very limited particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it. If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court that would I think be an appropriate outcome. Absolutely. Absolutely. You know Rachel you and I have talked about this before. I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall. I will be in Flint at the Mayor's invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is and is not happening. This is an emergency. Everyday that goes by that these people particularly the children are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child's life. I know from the work that I've done over so many years lead the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development your body development your behavior.I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient. We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring. That includes fixing their pipes it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan. If Michigan won't do it there have to be ways that we can begin to move and then make them pay for it and hold them accountable. You know Chuck I've only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator. And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator the CAFTA agreement because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America of our incomes and I opposed it. I did hope that the TPP negotiated by this administration would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements. And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration. Once I saw what the outcome was I opposed it.Now I have a very clear view about this. We have to trade with the rest of the world. We are 5 percent of the world's population. We have to trade with the other 95 percent. And trade has to be reciprocal. That's the way the global economy works.But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy. So it's not just what's in the trade agreement that I'm interested in.I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea. We go the UAW on board because of changes we made. So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved but I do not currently support it as it is written. Well II don't accept that premise Chuck. I think that we've got so much business we have to do. We've talked a lot tonight about what we're againstwe're against income inequality. We're against the abuses of powerful interests. We're against a lot of things. I'm for a lot of things. I don't want to just stop bad things from happening I want to start good things from happening. And I believe if I'm so fortunate to get the nomination I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed the first four years. I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years. I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act to get not only to 100 percent coverage but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.I want to move forward on paid family leave on early childhood education I want us to do more for small businesses. Small businesses have to create most of the jobs and we're not creating and growing small businesses. I think if you have a smart agenda you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various piecesbecause that's the way Congress is set up. You go through different committees and you really make a big push in the beginning.Immigration reform economic revitalization with manufacturing with infrastructurewe put it out there and we begin to work on an ambitious big bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country. The answer to both of those is no. I'm interested in making what we have work better. I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant. I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn't work and be absolutely clear we're getting rid of what doesn't work. I have had the opportunity to run a big agency. I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department betterbetter than anybody had run it in a long time. So I have an idea of what it's going to take to make our government work more efficiently.And when you put together a budget you have to make a lot of hard decisions but I think it's not appropriate to say ""I'm going to get rid of this get rid of that"" until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do.But I want to add something else you know because look we have so much work to do in our country and I think it's the greatest work that Americans will be called to do. And of course we have to have people in every community involved in it. We have to have the political voice the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve and we need to level with the American people about what they are what they will cost what will be expected of our citizenry. So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here's what we're trying to get done here's why I need your help here's why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn't something you care about but I'm telling you it will help fix the labor market it will bring people out of the shadows it will actually raise wages. You have to make all those connections so that you've got people with you every step of the way. That's what I want to do. I never said that. Look... Well I'm certainly going to unite the party but I'm notI'm not getting ahead of myself. I think that would be a little bit presumptuous. If I'm so fortunate as to be the nominee the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders. That's true. That's true. Well first thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary. I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart do they vote with their head I'm asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved. You know we didn't get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism with sexism with discrimination against the LGBT community with new Americans with people with disabilities. Yes we have income inequality we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders' supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country and I will bring that heart with me but I will also tell you we've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future."
2016-02-04 00:00:00,maddow, We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire. Tonight this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this. Face-to-face just one-on-one just the two of them. And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctionsshow us the differences between them. That's the whole reason that we're here tonight. We're not here for talking points. We're to learn about the difference between the candidates. And with that let's get going. Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders. And with that that's it. We're going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates. And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns we're going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now at this point in the campaign basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee. He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war if you are in favor of the death penalty if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP if you said single payer health care could never happen then you're too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party's standard bearer. Given those policy positions why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders? Senator Sanders have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic? Thank you Senator. Senator Sanders as a Vermonter you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire. But back home across the border you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate for governor Senate for Congress. In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently? Secretary Clinton. So Senator to that point Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats. She's implying that that says something about the people who know you best. How do you see it? Secretary. Senator Sanders you'll have 30 seconds to respond to that. Senator Sanders Secretary Clinton obviously we've touched a nerve. We're going to be back with more on this subject and much more right after this. Stay with us. Secretary Clinton on the issue of Wall Street... ... on the issue of Wall Street when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street. Last night when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches you said that's what they offered.Have you been too dismissive of voters' concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career? Senator Sanders you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street. What about her defense of her record? Senator Sanders let me turn to I think where this direction is heading anyway which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system. You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing and General Electric and Wal Mart. But some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans. That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business. The Affordable Care Act some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals. Could you work with them or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way you've approached them in this campaign? Senator Sanders thank you. And with that we're going to take a break. Welcome backwelcome back to the Democratic candidates' debate. We're going to be talking about America in the world both in terms of some trade issues but also national security. And Secretary Clinton we're going to start with you. There are more than 4000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS. It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for America's military families who have borne such a disproportionate burden.Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops that's fighting ISIS right now? To be clear to the specific question if that strategic goal that you're describing requires considerably more of Americansan ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria are you OK with the numbers increasing? Thank you Madam Secretary. Secretary Clinton at theat the last Democratic debate in CharlestonI want to get specific hereSenator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Your campaign has criticized him for saying that. Now that he's standing next to you here on this stage can you explain why the U.S. shouldn't try to normalize relations in Iran in your view? Secretary Clinton I want to ask you about a national security issue that is closer to home. There are thousands of veterans over 100000 veterans living in the state of New Hampshire. If either one of you is nominated as the Democratic Party's nominee you will likely face a Republican opponent in the general election who wants to privatize or even abolish big parts of the V.A. It's a newly popular idea in conservative politics.How will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A. in the last few years? What's your argument that the V.A. should still exist and should not be privatized? Senator Sanders you as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee you've worked in a very bipartisan way with Senator John McCain and others on veterans issues. Is the right contour of the fight the way she's talking about this issue? Thank you Senator. Senator Sanders Secretary Clinton we're going to take another break. We'll be talking about Social Security and some of those other issues when we come back. SenatorSenator Sanders in 1964... In 1964 I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater who was the hero of the conservative movement. He was however far to the right of most of that party. In 1972 the Democrats nominated George McGovern who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement but he was to the left of his party's mainstream. Both of those nominees made activists very excited and they both got destroyed in the general election. Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election. And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now. We know that. But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way you're running right now to try to get the nomination? Secretary Clinton your campaign surrogates and people who have endorsed you have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House. With him here standing next to you can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated? Senator Sanders thank you. Senator in December one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign. You apologized for that when the incident was made public. Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.None of these issues obviously is the end of the world but they all are of a piece. Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign? Just to follow up on that the title of the ad in question was Endorsement. Secretary Clinton do you want 30 seconds on that issue? And with that we will . Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire and the Democratic candidates' debate. Secretary Clinton on the issue of the death penalty here in New Hampshire the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer. It's a crime that has caused anguish in this state both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters.The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue on the death penalty you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide. Tonight do you still support capital punishment even if you do so reluctantly? Senator Sanders you have singled out the death penalty and Senator Clinton's support for the death penalty as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind... Another issue related to the proper role of government and in this case specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states. I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint Michigan. On the Flint lead poisoning disaster you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem and has not acted fast enough to fix it. You have both been outspoken on that. The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it. There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today. Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint even today. If the state is failing would you Secretary Clinton would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state? Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing? President Obama could be ordering done right now in Flint Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do? Senator thank you. The home stretch. Secretary Clinton Republicans particularly in campaign years often talk about which departments of governmentwhich agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president. The EPA the Department of Education the Commerce Department oopsisis there a department of government that you would get rid of? Or is there a whole new one that you would create? Thank you Secretary Clinton. Thank you very much. Thank you. We also want to thank our host the University of New Hampshire and the people of New Hampshire. You guys get to vote in just five days. I can't wait to see how it turns out. Don't screw up.
2016-02-04 00:00:00,todd," Good evening and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate. And neither party has seen this yet. These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president. Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you the voters can understand them and be fully informed. First I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire Union Leader for helping make this debate possible and the readers who helped provide some of the questions and topics that we'll be addressing tonight. The rules tonight by the way are simple: 90 seconds for answers 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. Thank you Senator. Secretary Clinton. All right. Let's get started.Secretary Clinton last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that quote ""It's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable."" So please tell us why you think if he's elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare that he cannot achieve those things. Thank you Secretary. Senator Sanders so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven't gotten any of these things passed. Why do you think as president you'll be able to achieve big big new programs like this? Go. Yes go ahead. All right thank you both. Rachel. I'd like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said Senator. President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty. President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP and just yesterday you said you can't be both a moderate or a progressive but you can't be both. Is President Obama in your judgment based on these policies positions a progressive? ...Secretary Clinton go ahead... 30 seconds and then we'll move. Thank you. ... Secretary we're gonna... Thirty seconds. Thank you both. All right welcome back. Let's get right to it. Senator Sanders you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform. You rail against big money in politics. But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place and it isit is in place to run for president. Why aren't you walking the walk on that?Why aren't you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics? Well going on that then why criticize her on Super PACs and you gotand all this when it isyou know that's the system? I mean you could be participating in a publicly-financingpublic financing system... ... and being able to setbeing able to set an example. ... she has had more people praise her plan than yours. Thank you both. Let me move on to our next question here and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News. Secretary Clinton it's addressed to you and it's about this issue of the speeches particularly to Goldman Sachs. This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.""I am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money"" and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches and then added ""Don't you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?""But let's make that bigger. Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches? We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches. In full disclosure would you release all of them? Senator you sound like you want to respond. Go ahead. We'll be right back. And we're going to get to trade and a lot of other issues. Go ahead Senator Sanders30 seconds your response. All right. Senator I want to stay though... Go ahead. 30 seconds. Let meletwe're gonnawe're stayingwe're staying basically on this topic. Obviously you've been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war but one place where you do agree and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force was in favor of the war in Afghanistan. Right now it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president perhaps President Sanders at least 10000 troops in Afghanistan. How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders? Can you address a question on Afghanistan? How long are these troops going to be there? If President Obama leaves you 10000 troops how long do you think they're going to be there? Secretary Clinton 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan? We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq. You know Senator Sanders nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are. You haven't given a major foreign policy speech. And it doesn't sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority other than when you're asked about it and you say you're going to crush ISIS as you said last night and earlier. You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet. Why? All right Senator 30 seconds. 30 seconds madam secretary. Alright as Commander in Chief Senator Sanders you've got to prioritize potential threats to the United States. Three countries North Korea Iran Russia. How would you rank them in order of their threat to America's security right now... ... Starting with the biggest threat. ... I didn't say that... ... No... ... We already had that. I'm talking about these three countries. How would you orient our national security our national defense posture. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter this week picked one of those three and he has said Russia is basically the most important national security threat. Sort of reorienting the defense and the challenges to that. Do you agree with his decisions... Secretary Clinton what do you think of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. He's basically putting Russia above Iran above North Korea as sort of the chief national security challenge right now. Thank you both Rachel? And we are back. We're gonna get into a little bit of election politics electability in a little bit. Senator Sanders The Iowa Democratic Party has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Monday's Iowa caucusesnarrowest of margins. Today the Des Moines Register has an editorial that calls for the audit of the results saying quote ""what happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle period. The results were too close not to do a complete audit.""Senator Sanders do you accept the idea that Hillary Clinton won Iowa? And do youor do you believe the caucuses are still an open question? Secretary Clinton will you participate in some sort of audit if that's what the party wants to do? You good with that? That's fair enough. OK. Good we move on. We're happy with that. We have more questions. We'll stay on this issue. We'll stay on this topic. Secretary Clinton just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders' ability in the general election many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire they tell our reporters over and over again they're worried about the emails issue not because they don't believe your explanation but because it's a drip-drip because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election.They see your numbers right now and they think it's the email issue as to why you're not polling very well. So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isn't going to blow up your candidacy if you're the nominee? All right Madam Secretary there is an openthere is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material. Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation? Well Senator sanders you famously at the first debate said you didn't give a darn about her emails; I think you used another . You're right. I'm trying toit's ait's a family hour still right now. After 11:00 I'll say it the other way. And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it but recently you called it a very serious issue and then the other day you said well she's getting slapped with the email controversy. Are youhow are you feeling about these darn emails now? OK. Senator Sanders thank you. Secretary Clinton let me turn to the issue of trade. In the '90s you supported NAFTA. But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008. As secretary of state you supported TPP and thenwhich of course is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president. If elected should Democrats expect that once you're in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again? Well Senator Sanders I know you want to respond on this you have never supported a trade deal since you've been in Congress. But if you do that as president... If you do that as president how are you not essentially letting China who will do all of these deals around the world how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world? All right. Thank you both. We're going to sneak in one more break here and when we come back we'll squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing. We'll be right back. All right. Welcome back here in the final minutes. The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary. Let me start with you Secretary Clinton on this question. Obviously President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half. You're going to have to make choices. And there's a lot of heavy lifts. And he made choices. He did healthcare and it came at the expense arguably of immigration reform. Had he put immigration reform first perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesn't.So there are three big lifts that you've talked about: immigration gun reform climate change. What do you do first? Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done. All right but Senator Sanders... ...you've still got to do something first. As you know history saidshows what you pick first is your best shot at getting and how you prioritize things. Immigration reform for instance fell by the wayside in the first term because of this. OK. Thank you. All right before we go I want to ask each one of these. Secretary Clinton you've made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders you do not see a president but do you see But do you seedo you see a vice president? Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate? Senator would you consider the secretary? Secretary Clinton closing statements. You are first. Thank you Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders. Well there you have it. I promise you Rachel and I have a lot more questions but we just don't have any more time unless we could a third hour but I don't think so. Our debate coverage debate coverage will continue in just a moment with our colleague .And we want to thank all of you for being here and we want to thank the two candidates for taking part in this important event. We'll see you in a few minutes. Thank you."
2015-11-14 00:00:00,sanders," Well John let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday. Together leading the world this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS. I'm running for president because as I go around this nation I talk to a lot of people. And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy. People are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent. And then on top of that we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process. What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying enough is enough. Our government belongs to all of us and not just the hand full of billionaires. Absolutely. In fact climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict. But of course international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today. And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said. But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary. I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours. Well in fact I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq something that I strongly opposed has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS. Now in fact what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone. What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life. I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now. I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States. I think we have a disagreement and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq. If you look at history John you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions these toppling of governments regime changes have unintended consequences. I would say that on this issue I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary... ... And that I am not a great fan of regime change. The Secretary's obviously right. It is enormously complicated. But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia Iran Turkey Jordan -- all of these nations they're going to have to get their hands dirty their boots on the ground. They are going to have to take on ISIS. This is a war for the soul of Islam. And those countries who are opposed to Islam they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today. We should be supportive of that effort. So should the UK so should France. But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort. They are not doing it now. When you talk about the long-term consequences of war let's talk about the men and women who came home from war. The 500000 who came home with PTSD and traumatic brain injury. And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us and that we stand with them as they have stood with us. I don't think the term is what's important. What is important to understand is we have organizations whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida who do believe we should go back several thousand years. We should make women third-class citizens that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted that they are a danger to modern society. And that this world with American leadership can and must come together to destroy them. We can do that. And it requires an entire world to come together including in a very active way the Muslim nations. Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue a very important issue that we have not yet discussed. This nation is the most powerful military in the world. We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism. We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5000 nuclear weapons. I think we need major reform in the military making it more cost effective but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us. The Cold War is over. And our focus has got to be on intelligence increased manpower fighting internationally targets. So in terms of refugees I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that of course we reach out. Now what the magic number is I don't know because we don't know the extent of the problem. But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people. Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right. That is what I want to do. That is what is going to have to happen if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class. In the last 30 years there has been a massive redistribution of wealth. And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous. The problem is this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction. Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own. Yes I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands. Yes I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation. We bailed out Wall Street. It's their time to bail out the middle class help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free. So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations who have gotten away with murder for years start paying their fair share. We haven't come up with an exact number yet but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower which was 90 percent. But it will be... I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower. But -- but we are going to end the absurdity as Warren Buffet often remind us. That billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers. That makes no sense at all. There has to be real tax reform and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president. I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act. We have made some good progress. Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day. I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States. But at the end of the day no doubt the Affordable Care Act is a step forward. I think we all support it. I believe we've got to go further. I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right not a privilege. And also -- also what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country and our outcomes health care outcomes are not necessarily that good. Kathie let me say this. You know no public policy doesn't have in some cases negative consequences. But at the end of the day what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low. Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years. So I believe that in fact this country needs to move towards a living wage. It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week that person should not be living in poverty. It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids. So I believe that over the next few years not tomorrow but over the next few years we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage 15 bucks an hour. And I apologize to nobody for that. This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income. You have no disposable income when you are make 10 12 bucks an hour. When we put money into the hands of working people they're going to go out and buy goods they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that. Kathie that is the kind of economy I believe put money in the hands of working people raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour. Let me just... Let me just add to that. Just because this is not an esoteric argument. You're seeing cities like Seattle. You're seeing cities like San Francisco cities like Los Angeles doing it and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income. Not good enough. Here's the story. I mean you know let's not be naive about it. Why do -- why over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? You know maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get but I don't think so. Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street. It ain't complicated. You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America. They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages. If Teddy Roosevelt a good Republican were alive today you know what he'd say? ""Break them up."" Reestablish Glass-Steagall. And Teddy Roosevelt is right. That is the issue. Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC. I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money. I will break up these banks. Support community banks and credit unions. That's the future of banking in America. I have never heard a candidate never who has received huge amounts of money from oil from coal from Wall Street from the military industrial complex not one candidate say oh these campaign contributions will not influence me. I'm going to be independent. Well why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? they expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors 750000 of them 30 bucks a piece. That's who I'm indebted to. No I have not. So was I John. Let me get a chance to respond. This issue touches on two broad issues. It's not just Wall Street. It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system. And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions and that's what I'm doing. In terms of Wall Street I respectfully disagree with you madam secretary in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth. When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated the only answer they know is break them up reestablish Glass-Stegall. The big banks-- Look-- I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary Wall Street played by the rules? Who are we kidding? The business model of Wall Street is fraud. That's what it is. And we have -- and let me make this promise. One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations. Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet. Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity. Let's... Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself. I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check and I want to see it improved and expanded. I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole. In 1988 I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America. We have to do away with the strawman proposal. We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need. We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here... The issue is -- I believe and I believe this honestly and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us. But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues. The problem is... ... people all over this country -- not you Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other. And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do. Absolutely. Yes. Yes. Yes I agree. Well I -- if I might. I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton. She did. She's the senator from New York. She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation. But at the end of the day Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power. Their business model is greed and fraud. And for the sake of our economy they must -- the major banks must be broken up. Well (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall. I led the effort unfortunately unsuccessfully against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good. The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall. And Secretary Clinton unfortunately is on the wrong side. Let me... Thank you. Looking forward to it. Yes. Right. And we are going to do a political revolution which brings working people young people senior citizens minorities together. Because every issue that I am talking about-- paid family and medical leave breaking up the banks on Wall Street asking the wealth to pay their fair share of taxes rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour -- every one of those issues is supported by a significant majority of the American people. The problem is that as a result of a corrupt campaign finance system Congress is not listening to the American people. Its listening to the big money interest. What the political revolution is about is bringing people together to finally say enough is enough. This government belongs to us. Not just the billionaires. Yes. Yes. Yeah. What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class we can bring about the change that we need. If we are not successful if we continue the same old same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests nothing changes. What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people mostly young people. What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people. We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America. That's what the political revolution is about. No. That's just media stuff. I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails. And the issue is the problem is the front pages every day were dealing with it. I didn't know I had so much power. But after I said that we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing why we have more people in jail than any other country why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave. We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails good. Let's go to the major issues facing America. Well this is what I would say and the Congressman was right. According to the statistics that I'm familiar with a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system. Fifty-one percent of high school African-American graduates are unemployed or underemployed. We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth. We're spending $80 billion locking people up disproportionately Latino and African American. We need very clearly major major reform in a broken criminal justice system. From top to bottom. And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed they must be held accountable. It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested. It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana. No it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country. Germany many other countries do it already. In fact if you remember 50 60 years ago the University of California City University of New York were virtually tuition-free. Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50000 or $100000 in debt. More importantly I want kids in Burlington Vermont or Baltimore Maryland who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade who don't have a lot of money whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college. Do you know where I'm going Kevin? I want those kids to know that if they study hard they do their homework regardless of the income of their families they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. This is revolutionary for education in America. It will give hope to millions of young people. Yes. Well I think that they're be pretty smart because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty. Bottom line here is in the year 2015 we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago. If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers and we need carpenters and electricians that's for sure and they should get help as well. But bottom line now is in America in the year 2015 any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education college education regardless of the income of his or her family. And we must substantially lower as my legislation does interest rates on student debt. It's not going to happen tomorrow. And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies. But at the end of the day Nancy here is the question -- in this great country of ours with so much intelligence and so much capability why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right? Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want? Why is it that we are spending per capita far far more than Canada which is 100 miles away from my door that guarantees health care to all people? It will not happen tomorrow. But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies it will happen and I will lead that effort. Medicare for all single-payer system is the way we should go. Well let me just say something. We don't eliminate Medicare. We expand Medicare to all people. And we will not under this proposal have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina and many other Republican states that because of their right wing political ideology are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act. Ultimately we have got to say as a nation Secretary Clinton is health care a right of all people or is it not? I believe it is a right. John I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years. And in that capacity I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II from korea vietnam all of the wars. People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs without arms. And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending. We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion the VFW the DOD Vietnam Vets all of the veterans organizations which was comprehensive. Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades. I could only get two Republican votes on that. We ended up with 56 votes. We needed 60. So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted. Sit down with people like John Mccain. Sit down with people like Jeff Miller the Republican chairman of the house and work on a bill. It wasn't the bill that I wanted but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history. So the crisis was I lost what I wanted. But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could. John -- John this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth. We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs. We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave. That's not the America that I think we should be. But in order to bring about the changes that we need we need a political revolution. Millions of people are going to have to stand up turn off the TV get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country. Please go to berniesanders.com. Please become part of the political revolution. Thank you."
2015-11-14 00:00:00,clinton," Well our prayers are with the people of France tonight but that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS a barbaric ruthless violent jihadist terrorist group. This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief. And I will be laying out in detail what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism. Our country deserves no less because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong. Well John I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained it must be defeated. There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal not just military force which should be used as a last resort but our diplomacy our development aid law enforcement sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together. But it cannot be an American fight. And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS. That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs so that we can be supportive. But this cannot be an American fight although American leadership is essential. Well John look I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011 is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq. Unfortunately Nouri al-Maliki the prime minister set about decimating it. And then with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum. So yes this has developed. I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility. I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself. Thank you John. Well thank you John. I think it's important we put this in historic context. The United States has unfortunately been victimized by terrorism going back decades. In the 1980s it was in Beirut Lebanon under President Reagan's administration and 258 Americans marines embassy personnel and others were murdered. We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania Kenya when my husband was president. Again Americans murdered. And then of course 9/11 happened which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq. I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake. But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it. Well of course each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed. Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles. So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush. This is an incredibly complicated region of the world. It's become more complicated. And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in. The Shi'a-Sunni split. The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations. The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life. We saw that in Egypt. We saw a dictator overthrown. We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed and then we saw him ousted and the army back. So I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East. Well I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned most particularly Jordan which has put a lot on the line for the United States has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria and has been therefore subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves. I do agree that in particular Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds. Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not? And there are many ways of doing it. They can provide forces. They can provide resources. But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand. Well we did have a plan and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else. And when he moved on his own people threatening a massacre genocide the Europeans and the Arabs our allies and partners did ask for American help and we provided it. And we didn't put a single boot on the ground and Gaddafi was deposed. The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful fairest elections that any Arab country has had. They elected moderate leaders. Now there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability from north Africa to Afghanistan. And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya. Well I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid. Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone sometimes with our military into very dangerous places in Iraq in Afghanistan elsewhere. So there does need to be a whole of government approach but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome. These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made. I don't think we're at war with Islam. I don't think we're at war with all Muslims. I think we're at war with jihadists who have -- I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries. We've got to have them be part of our coalition. If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam that was one of the real contributions despite all the other problems that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington we are not at war with Islam or Muslims. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression. And yes we are at war with those people. But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush. I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism it's very hard to understand other than the lust for power the rejection of modernity the total disregard for human rights freedom or any other value that we know and respect. Historically it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking what they will be doing how they will react. I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe. Yes. Well we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists. We passed it after 9/11. It certainly does cover it. I would like to see it updated. No it would have to go through the Congress and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress. Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends come up with better intelligence. You know it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places but we have to keep trying. And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to Syria especially the ones with western passports that come back. So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF has the authority that is needed going forward. I think that is the number one requirement. I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees. The administration originally said 10. I said we should go to 65 but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to in any way inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country. But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said. We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future not the past. But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges. We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations. We have problems with Russia. Just the other day Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon. So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach. Well first of all it isn't the middle class. I have made very clear that hardworking middle-class families need a raise not a tax increase. In fact wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century after my husband's administration. So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again get incomes rising again. And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site hillaryclinton.com and read the details. And I will pay for it by yes taxing the wealthy more closing corporate loopholes deductions and other kinds of favorable treatment. And I can do it without raising the debt without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time. Well we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business. For example it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices. In fact American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA. So there's more to my plan than just the cap. We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate. Well look I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act. We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman. And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party but of President Obama. I do think that it's important to defend it. The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times. They would like to rip it up and start all over again throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now. I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act. I would certainly tackle the cost issues because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women for example that yes we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market how to get the costs of -- particularly prescription drugs but other out-of-pocket expenses down. But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality affordable health care for everyone. And it's-- it's a worthy debate. It's an important one that we should be engaged in. Well first of all I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. Border security has always been a part of that debate. And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out. So what we want to do is to say look we have 11 million people who have been here many of them for decades. They have children who are doing so well I've met and worked with dreamers. I think any parent would be so proud of them. So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship. Kathie I think -- Kathie the... But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously. He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage and what its effects are. And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss. However what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15 there are no international comparisons. That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage. That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal. But I do believe that is a minimum. And places like Seattle like Los Angeles like New York City they can go higher. It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state. There was a minimum wage at the state level and some places went higher. I think that is... I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had. But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage. Of course you would. Do the $12 and you would index it. But I... He's not wall street. That's not fair. He's a progressive economist. Well I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will. You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak. So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate. I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation. I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena. And specifically said to Wall Street that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down. I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks. That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them. I have a comprehensive tough plan. But I went further than that. We have to go after what is called the shadow banking industry. Those hedge funds. Look at what happened in '08 AIG a big insurance company Lehman Brothers an investment bank helped to bring our economy down. So I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth. Well John wait a minute. Wait a minute he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity. Let's be frank here. Oh wait a minute senator. You know not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors most of them small. And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women 60 percent. So I represented New York and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country. So you know it's fine for you to say what you're going to say but I looked very carefully at your proposal. Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help but it is nowhere near enough. My proposal is tougher more effective and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks. Well you know governor I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation you chose an investment banker in 2010. So for me it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08. And I will go back and say again AIG was not a big bank. It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us. Lehman Brothers was not a big bank. It was an investment bank. And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us. So I've said if the big banks don't play by the rules I will break them up. And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country. Well I think that there are different records. I -- you know know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers. That was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators not just in Washington but across the country. But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas nearly 3000 people have been killed by guns. Twenty-one mass shootings including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered. Two hundred children have been killed. This is an emergency. There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them. I agree with that. That's why I've got such a good plan. But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks. Close the gun show loophole close the online loophole and... I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished. I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience. Let's reverse the immunity. Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it. But wait I just want to say this Senator. There is broad consensus 92 percent in the most recently poll of Americans want gun safety measures... ... and 85 percent of gun owners agree. We've got the consensus what we're lacking is political leadership... ... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate. Well I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild. So yes I did know people. I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say I don't agree with you on everything but I like what you do. I like how you stand up. I'm going to support you and I think that is absolutely appropriate. Well I'll tell you who is on my side. Paul Krugman the Nobel Prize winning economist who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better. Paul Volcker one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall. So I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion. I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall. I just don't think it would get the job done. I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do. I agree completely. I couldn't have said it better myself. But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up. Look we need more Americans to be involved in the political process. And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young old everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard. Look at what's happening with the Republicans. They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard. They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote. So we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly. But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington despite the Republican obstructionists. I think after 11 hours that's pretty clear yes. And you know I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about and that they talk to each of us about. And to contrast even -- there are differences among us. You've heard some of those tonight. I still want to get back to health care because I think that's a worthy topic to explore. But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side. And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans. I mean all of us support funding Planned Parenthood. All of us believe climate change is real. All of us want equal pay for equal work. They don't believe in any of that. So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about. Well John I come from the '60s a long time ago. There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism antiwar activism women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out. Obviously I believe that on a college campus there should be enough respect so people hear each other. But what happened at the university there what's happening at other universities I think reflects the deep sense of you know concern even despair that so many young people particularly of color have... You know I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods and hearing their stories was so incredibly profoundly heartbreaking. Each one of them you know described their child had a picture. You know the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and you know some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down. Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home absolutely stellar young woman hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member. And of course I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children. So your original question is the right question. And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer. It's really a question for all of us to answer every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential. And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country. Kevin if I could just jump in. I -- I believe that we should make community college free. We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university. You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition. I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference whether a young person can stay in school or not. I disagree with free college for everybody. I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college. I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute kids contribute. And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future. No. Revolution never came. I waited and I got the scars to show for it. We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats. We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it. I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed and basically he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act eliminates private insurance eliminates Medicare eliminates Medicaid Tricare children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer. And I have to tell you I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa Terry Branstad administering my health care. I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act improve it and make it the model that we know it can be. Well there are so many I don't know where to start. I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden. I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us. But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it. The intelligence was by no means absolute. We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and you know at the end I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice. It was an excruciating experience. I couldn't talk to anybody about it. In fact after it happened the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill ""Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."" And Bill said ""No no she hasn't."" There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face. Well thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you. I've heard a lot about me in this debate and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately I think the president's job is to do everything possible everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country. Starting with our children and moving forward. I've spent my entire life since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America this great country of ours who are behind who don't have a chance. And that's what I will do as your president. I will work my heart out. I need your help. All of you in Iowa I need you to caucus for me. Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be."
2015-11-14 00:00:00,cordes," John thanks so much. We've learned a lot during the course of this campaign about the things that you'd like to do that you say would help the middle class but we haven't heard quite as much about who would pick up the tab. So Secretary Clinton first to you. You want to cap individuals' prescription drug costs at $250 a month. You want to make public college debt-free. You want community college to be free altogether. And you want mandatory paid family leave. So who pays for all that? Is it employers? Is it the taxpayers and which taxpayers? But a quick follow-up on that $250-a-month cap. Wouldn't the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies just pass that cost on to the consumers in the form of higher premiums? Governor O'Malley you also want to make public college debt-free. You want... ... states to freeze tuition. You've got your own family leave plan. How would you pay for it? In Maryland you raised the sales tax you raised the gas tax and you raised taxes on families making over $150000 a year. Is that the blueprint? Senator Sanders you want to make public college free altogether. You want to increase Social Security benefits and you want to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. So you said that to do some of these things you'll impose a tax on top earners. How high would their rate go in a Sanders administration? But let's get specific. How high would you go? You have said before you would go above 50 percent. How high? Secretary Clinton Americans say that health care costs and wages are their top financial concerns. And health care deductibles alone have risen 67 percent over the past five years. Is this something that Obamacare was designed to address? And if not why not? It is -- it is a worthy debate. Senator Sanders a quick response and then we'll get into health care again later. There was a lot of conversation on twitter about guns but also about your conversation on campaign finance. And Secretary Clinton one of the tweets we saw said this ""I've never seen a candidate invoke 9/11 to justify millions of Wall Street donations until now."" The idea being yes you were a champion of the community after 9/11 but what does that have to do with taking big donations? Hold on. Senator Sanders -- I'm sorry. Senator Sanders but what is it in Secretary Clinton's record that shows you that she's been influenced by those donations? Back to health care by popular demand. First to you Senator Sanders. You'd prefer to scrap Obamacare and move to a single-payer system essentially Medicare for all. You say you want to put the private insurance companies out of business. Is it realistic to think that you can pull the plug on a $1 trillion industry? Secretary Clinton back in -- Secretary Clinton back in 1994 you said that momentum for a single-payer system would sweep the country. That sounds Sanders-esque. But you don't feel that way anymore why not?"
2015-11-14 00:00:00,moderators, Nancy Cordes (CBS News); Kevin Cooney (CBS News); John Dickerson (CBS News); and Kathie Obradovich (The Des Moines Register)
2015-11-14 00:00:00,obradovich, Senator Sanders you've actually talked about immigration as being a wage issue in the United States. And I want to actually go directly to the wage issue now. You called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour everywhere in the country. But the President's former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Alan Krueger has said a national increase of $15 could lead to undesirable and unintended consequences of job loss. What level of job loss would you consider unacceptable? You said there are consequences... You said there are consequences for -- for any policy. Do you think job losses are a consequence that are... You're calling for a $15 an hour wage now but why did you stop at $10.10 in your state? Yes Senator Sanders you famously said in the last debate that you were sick and tired of hearing about your damn e- mails. But then you told the Wall Street Journal that the question about whether or not Secretary Clinton's e-mails compromised classified information were valid questions. So which is it? Is it an issue or is it not? I'm sorry I couldn't hear you. Secretary Clinton your response.
2015-11-14 00:00:00,cooney, Thanks John. Candidates we've already heard your answers on what you would do with Syrian refugees but a crucial part of the immigration debate here at home is control of our own borders. Republicans say the borders -- securing borders is a top priority. Democrats say they want to plan for comprehensive immigration reform. So Governor O'Malley are you willing to compromise on this particular issue to focus on border security first in favor of keeping the country safe? Thank you. Now Secretary Clinton said you would go further than the President when it comes to taking executive action to implement immigration reforms. But the President's already facing legal trouble on this. We've seen it more just in the past week. Realistically how could you go further with executive action? Kathie. Senator -- Senator Sanders we've heard a lot about this your offer -- you want to offer free tuition to public universities and colleges. A couple of questions about this. 63 percent of those who enroll graduate. First question isn't this throwing a lot of money away if we're looking at a third of these people are not going to complete college? Well one of the things you want to do is to have the states pay for about a third of this $70 billion plan correct? There are 16 states that are running budget deficits right now. Where are are they expected to come up with this? Governor O'Malley jump in now. All right Nancy Cordes has a question.
2015-11-14 00:00:00,<b>o'malley, John I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening. But accommodating 65000 refugees in our country today people of 320 million is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32000. There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike. But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says. The nature of warfare has changed. This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines. This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops better intelligence and being more proactive. That's what I understand is the request from the international... I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach. That's right. Nancy the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment. And yes we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions. So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating but the highest median income in America. I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation investing in the skills of our people our infrastructure and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains. I believe capital gains for the most part should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work sweat and toil. And if we do those things we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
2015-11-14 00:00:00,o'malley," My heart like all of us in this room John and all the people across our country my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss. Parents and sons and daughters and family members and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them we must remember this that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century. And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation. We must able to work collaboratively with others. We must anticipate these threats before they happen. This is the new sort of challenge the new sort of threat that does in fact require new thinking fresh approaches and new leadership. As a former mayor and a former governor there was never a single day John when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country. We have a lot of work to do to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century. John I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score. This actually is America's fight. It cannot solely be America's fight. America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies. America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world. And ISIS make no mistake about it is an evil in this world. ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner. ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France. And we do have a role in this. Not solely ours but we must work collaboratively with other nations. The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years John has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground. Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple. Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope. Make ourselves stronger at home but also our role in the world yes is also to confront evil when it rises. We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan but now there is undoubtedly a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are. John may I -- may I interject here? Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and indeed it was. But it was also the cascading effects that followed that. It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS. It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up. We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict. It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator. It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next. John the world is a very dangerous place but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America provided we act according to our principles provided we act intelligently. I mean let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about. Libya is now a mess. Syria is a mess. Iraq is a mess. Afghanistan is a mess. As Americans we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability. And I wanted to add one other thing John and I think it's important for all of us on this stage. I was in Burlington Iowa. And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said Governor O' Malley please when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'. Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'. My son is not a pair of boots on the ground. These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development diplomacy and our economic power in alignment with our principles. I believe calling it what it is is to say radical jihadis. That's calling it what it is. But John let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here. They are our first line of defense. And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there as well as in this world because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion. And now like never before we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this. That's right. And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term the highest marginal rate was 70 percent. And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy millionaire and billionaire category a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class. All right Nancy I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one John... Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs so whenever we come... Thank you. Well Mr. Cooney we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform. In fact if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table it would have happened long ago. The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump the truth of the matter is... The truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact check me. Go ahead. Check it out. But the truth of the matter is if we want wages to go up we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy and into the full light of an American economy. That's what our parents and grandparents always did. That's what we need to do as a nation. Yes we must protect our borders. But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America. Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty. It is not a barbed wire fence. Kathie this was not merely theory in Maryland. We actually did it. Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage. We were the first to pass a minimum wage. And the U.S. chamber of commerce which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship. We defended the highest median income in the country. And so look the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth. And if our middle class makes more money they spend more money and our whole economy grows. We did it and it worked and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it. $10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year. But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives if they were here tonight would also tell you that it works. The fact of the matter is the more our people earn the more money they spend and the more our whole economy grows. That's American capitalism. Didn't just happen. Come on now. Yeah but look. It should always be going up. Again with all do respect to Secretary Clinton... I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street... ... And start taking advice... John please it's-- personal privilege John. John John Well I'll tell you what I've said this before. I don't -- I believe that we actually need some new economic thinking in the White House. And I would not have Robert Rubin or Larry Summers with all due respect Secretary Clinton to you and to them back on my council of economic advisers. They are the architects. Sure we'll have an inclusive group but I won't be taking my orders from Wall Street. And look let me say this. I put out a proposal. I was on the front lines when people lost their homes when people lost their jobs. I was on the front lines as a governor fighting against -- fighting that battle. Our economy was wrecked by the big banks of Wall Street. And Secretary Clinton when you put out your proposal on Wall Street it was greeted by many as quote unquote ""Weak tea"". It is weak tea. It is not what the people expect of our country. We expect that our president will protect the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And that's why Bernie's right. We need to reinstate a modern version of Glass-Steagall and we should have done it already. Oh yes there is. I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America but the issue is... But it's a lot safer. It's saved a lot of lives along the way Senator. I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here... John I think somewhere between... John there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets. That's not capitalism Secretary Clinton. That's crony capitalism. That's a wonderful business model. If you place bad bets the taxpayers bail you out. But if you place good ones you pocket it. Look I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance Secretary Sanders but Secretary Clinton we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street. I am not the candidate of Wall Street... ... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism. John I think the -- I think the call of your question is how can we improve both public safety in America and race relations in America understanding how very intertwined both of those issues are in a very very difficult and painful way for us as a people. Look the truth of the matter is that we should all feel a sense of responsibility as Americans to look for the things that actually work to save and redeem lives and to do more of them and to stop doing the things that don't. For my part that's what I have done in 15 years of experience as a mayor and as a governor. We restored voting rights to 52000 people. We decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana. I repealed the death penalty. And we also put in place a civilian review board. We reported openly discourtesy and lethal force and brutality complaints. This is something that -- and I put forward a new agenda for criminal justice reform that is informed by that experience. So as president I would lead these efforts and I would do so with more experience and probably the attendance at more grave sites than any of the three of us on this stage when it comes to urban crime loss of lives. And the truth is I have learned on a very daily basis that yes indeed black lives matter. Okay thank you. I have -- look I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says Kevin. I believe that actually affordable college debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation. And unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition. I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach. I believe that the goal should be debt-free college. I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants. States need to stop cutting higher education and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government. 7 percent and 8 percent to go to college? I mean my dad went to college on a G.I. Bill after coming home from Japan flying 33 missions. My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills. We were proud of them on graduation day but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives. It -- it doesn't need to be that way. We can have debt-free college in the United States. May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care? John I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say therefore I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with. But I can tell you this. I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States the president whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country. You learn that threats always change. You learn to create a security cabinet. You learn to create feedback mechanisms. You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with. I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies whether they were inflicted by drug gangs whether they were natural emergencies I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life. John thank you and to all of the people in Iowa for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process. If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking new and fresh approaches then I ask you to join my campaign. Go on to martinomalley.com. No hour is too short no dollar too small. If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past or by returning to polarizing figures from our past. We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress but it's going to require that we act as Americans based on our principles here at home making an economy that works for all of us. And also acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners. There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days. I need your help. Thank you very very much."
2015-11-14 00:00:00,dickerson," Before we start the debate here are the rules. The candidates have one minute to respond to our questions and 30 seconds to respond to our follow-up. Any candidate who is attacked by another candidate gets 30 seconds for rebuttal. Here's how we'll keep time after a question is asked the green light goes on. When there are 15 seconds left the candidate gets a yellow warning light. And when time's up the light turns red. That means stop talking. Those are the rules. So let's get started. You will each have one minute for an opening statement to share your thoughts about the attacks in your Paris and lay out your visions for America. First Senator Sanders. All right Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton. Governor O'Malley. All right thank you Governor. Thank all of you. The terror attacks last night underscore biggest challenge facing the next president of the United States. At a time of crisis the country and the world look to the president for leadership and for answers. So Secretary Clinton I'd like to start with you. Hours before the attacks President Obama said ""I don't think ISIS is gaining strength."" Seventy-two percent of Americans think the fight against ISIS is going badly. Won't the legacy of this administration which is-- which you were a part of won't that legacy be that it underestimated the threat from ISIS? But as -- Secretary Clinton the question was about was ISIS underestimated? And I'll just add the president referred to ISIS as the JVU (sic) in a speech at the Council of Foreign Relations in June of 2014 said ""I could not have predicted the extent to which ISIS could be effective in seizing cities in Iraq."" So you've got prescriptions for the future but how do we even those prescript prescriptions are any good if you missed it in the past? Okay Governor O'Malley would you critique the administration's response to ISIS. If the United States doesn't lead who leads? Senator Sanders you said you want to rid the planet of ISIS. In the previous debate you said the greatest threat to national security was climate change. Do you still believe that? Quickly just let me ask you a follow-up on that Senator Sanders. When you say the disastrous vote on Iraq let's just be clear about what you're saying. You're saying Secretary Clinton who was then Senator Clinton voted for the Iraq war. And are you making a direct link between her vote for that or and what's happening now for ISIS. Just so everybody... Alright. Let's let Secretary Clinton respond to that. Senator Sanders let me just follow this line of thinking. You criticized then Senator Clinton's vote. Do you have anything to criticize in the way she performed as Secretary of State? Alright. Senator let me... All right Secretary Clinton. I understand. Quickly Senator. Secretary Clinton. Let me ask you Secretary Clinton a question about leadership. We're talking about what role does America take? Let me ask you about Libya. So Libya is a country in which ISIS has taken hold in part because of the chaos after Muammar Gaddafi. That was an operation you championed. President Obama says this is the lesson he took from that operation. In an interview he said the lesson was do we have an answer for the day after? Wasn't that suppose to be one of the lessons that we learned after the Iraq war? And how did you get it wrong with Libya if the key lesson of the Iraq war is have a plan for after? Governor O' Malley I want to ask you a question and you can add whatever you'd like to. But let me ask you is the world too dangerous a place for a governor who has no foreign policy experience? Secretary Clinton you mentioned radical jihadists. Marco Rubio also running for president said that this attack showed and the attack in Paris showed that we are at war with radical Islam. Do you agree with that characterization radical Islam? Just to interrupt. He didn't say all Muslims. He just said radical Islam. Is that a phrase you don't... The reason I ask is you gave a speech at Georgetown University in which you said that it was important to show quote ""respect even for one's enemies. Trying to understand and in so far as psychologically possible empathize with their perspective and point of view."" Can you explain what that means in the context of this kind of barbarism? Just quickly do either of you radical Islam do either of you use that phrase? Governor O' Malley you have been making the case when you talk about lack of forward vision you're essentially saying that Secretary Clinton lacks that vision and this critique matches up with this discussion of language. The critique is that the softness of language betrays a softness of approach. So if this language -- if you don't call it by what it is how can your approach be effective to the cause? that's the critique. Secretary Clinton the French president has called this attack an act of war. A couple of days ago you were asked if you would declare war on ISIS and you said no. What would you say now? And you think that covers all of this? If you were in the Senate would you be okay with the commander in chief doing that without it coming back to you? Senator let me just -- let's add to whatever you've got to say. Refugees. You've been a little vague on what you would do about the Syrian refugees. What's your view on them now? Governor O'Malley you have a magic number. I think it's 65000. Does that number go up or down based on what happened yesterday? Just very quickly 65000 the number stays? But for you what would you want? Secretary Clinton let me ask you a question from twitter which has come in and this is a question on this issue of refugees. The question is with the U.S. preparing to absorb Syrian refugees how do you propose we screen those coming in to keep citizens safe? Alright. Senator Sanders I'm sorry. We're going to have to take a break now. We will have more of the Democratic debate here from Drake University in Des Moines Iowa. Want to turn now from terrorism to another important issue for many Americans the financial squeeze on the the middle class. For that we go to my CBS News Colleague Nancy Cordes. Nancy? All right I am sorry Governor we're going to have to go I apologize. Governor -- Governor you're breaking the rules. I'm sorry we're going to have to cut for a commercial. We'll be right back here from Drake University here in Des Moines Iowa. There is a lot of presidential history here in Iowa. It hosted the first in the nation caucuses. Herbert Hoover was born in West Branch and tonight we are in Polk County named for our 11th president with three people who hope to be number 45. Joining my now to question them are Iowans Kevin Cooney of KCCI and Kathie Obradovich of the Des Moines Register. Kevin? You have -- you have given me the perfect segue. We are going to talk about Wall Street but now we've got to go do a commercial. We're coming to the end of the first hour. But there's another hour behind it and we're going to talk about Wall Street so hang with us. Good evening again as we begin the second half of the debate. Joining me in the questioning are the candidates -- of the candidates are CBS news congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes Kevin Cooney of CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI and Kathie Obradovich of the Des Moines register. As those who watched the first hour know our topic is Wall Street. For those just joining us welcome. Senator -- excuse me Secretary Clinton I went to the past there for a moment. Senator Sanders recently said quote ""People should be suspect of candidates who receive large sums of money from Wall Street and then go out and say 'Trust me. I'm going to really regulate wall street'. So you've received millions of dollars in contributions and speaking fees from from Wall Street companies. How do you convince voters that you are going to level the playing field when you're indebted to some of its biggest players? Senator Sanders you said that the donations to Secretary Clinton are compromising. So what did you think of her answer? Great follow up because you -- and Secretary Clinton you will get a chance to respond. You said they know what they're going to get. What are they going to get? Hold on. He was attacked. Hold on he was attacked. Glass-Steagall... All right. Senator we have to get Governor O' Malley in. Governor along with your answer how many Wall Street veterans would you have in your administration? Anyone from Wall Street? Hold on. All right I want to switch to the -- switch to the issue of guns here. Secretary Clinton you said that Senator Sanders is not tough enough on guns but basically he now supports roughly the same things you do. So can tell us what the exact difference is going forward between the two of you on the issue of gun control? Secretary Clinton I want to... Secretary Clinton just a quick follow-up. You say that Senator Sanders took a vote that -- on immunity that you don't like. So if he can be tattooed by a single vote and that ruins all future opinions by him on this issue why then isn't he right when he says your wrong vote on Iraq tattoos you forever in your judgment? But was that a mistake Senator? Hold on. Sorry. I'm going to bring in Nancy Cordes with a question from twitter about this exchange. Final word. Final word Governor O'Malley before we go to commercial. We have to -- we have to go for a commercial Senator. I'm sorry. We have to go for a commercial here. We'll be right back with the Democratic debate here in Des Moines Iowa on CBS. Back now in Des Moines with the candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. Senator Sanders I want to start with you. Let's say you're elected president. Congratulations. You've said you'll have a revolution. But there's a conservative revolution going on in America right now. As John Boehner knows and as Democrats know who have lost in state houses across the country. Those conservatives are watching tonight and probably shaking their heads. So how do you deal with that part of the country? The revolution's already happening but on the other side? Senator as a 30-second follow-up we've heard already tonight this figure 92 percent of support for background checks. Let's look at that as an example. There was something 92 percent of the public was for. There had been these mass shootings. There was emotional support behind it. Bipartisan support. The president the full force of his office. It went nowhere. That's the model you're talking about. Nothing happened. A question from Kathie Obradovich. Secretary Clinton just one more question on the e- mail question. For Democrats there's an FBI investigation going on. Can you satisfy Democrats who might worry about an another shoe dropping that you and your staff have been totally truthful to them and that another shoe is not going to drop? Race relations is another issue everyone cares about and we're going to switch to that now. Governor O'Malley let me ask you a question. The head of the FBI recently said it might be possible that some police forces are not enforcing the law because they're worried about being caught on camera. The acting head of the drug enforcement administration said a similar thing. Where are you on this question? And what would do you if you were president and two top members of your administration were floating that idea? All right Governor... Senator Sanders one of your former colleagues an African- American member of Congress said to me recently that a young African- American man had asked him where to find hope in life. And he said ""I just don't know what to tell him about being young and black in America today."" What would you tell that young African-American man? Secretary Clinton you told some Black Lives Matter activists recently that there's a difference between rhetoric in activism and what you were trying to do was -- get laws passed that would help what they were pushing for. But recently at the University of Missouri that activism was very very effective. So would you suggest that kind of activism take place at other universities across the country? All right over to Kevin Cooney. Thirty seconds. I'm sorry governor. We've got to take a break or the machine breaks down. You're watching the Democratic debate here on CBS. We begin the final segment of this debate with something none of you saw coming. Something quite unexpected. Soon after your inauguration you will face a crisis. All presidents do. What crisis you have experienced in your life that suggests you've been testd and can face that inevitable challenge? Secretary Clinton you first. Governor O' Malley what crisis proves that you're tested? Senator Sanders what experience would you draw on in a crisis? All right Senator Sanders... We've ended the evening on crisis which underscores and reminds us again of what happened last night. Now let's move to closing statements. Governor O'Malley you're first. Secretary Clinton? Senator Sanders?"
2016-02-25 00:00:00,moderator, Wolf Blitzer (CNN); with PANELISTS: Maria Celeste Arrars (Telemundo); Dana Bash (CNN); and Hugh Hewitt (Salem Radio Network)
2016-02-25 00:00:00,cooper, Secretary Clinton what would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?
2016-02-25 00:00:00,trump," Thank you. My whole theme is make America great again. We don't win anymore as a country. We don't win with trade we don't win with the military. ISIS we can't even knock out ISIS and we will believe me. We will. We don't win in any capacity with healthcare. We have terrible health care Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced. We just don't win.You look at our borders they're like swiss cheese everybody pours in.We're going to make a great country again. We're going to start winning again. We're going to win a lot it's going to be a big difference believe me. It's going to be a big difference. First of all he was in charge of amnesty he was the leader and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had. As far as coming back in number one you wouldn't even be talking and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration. It wouldn't even be a big subject.But we either have a country or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back some will come back the best through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process and it may not be a very quick process but I think that's very fair and very fine.They're going to get in line with other people. The best of them will come back but they're going to come back through a process. Well I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio and two days ago he totally endorsed me so thank you. Well first of all self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s they started moving people out and the rest of them left. Self-deportation as I really define it and that's the way I define it is you're going to get some to go and the rest are going to go out.As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season like Palm Beach and other locations you could not get help. It's the up season. People didn't want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs very seasonal 90-day jobs 120-day jobs and you couldn't get.Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them or we just might as well close the doors because you couldn't get help in those hot hot sections of Florida. I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president. He ran a terrible campaign. He was a terrible candidate. That's what I criticize Mitt Romney I mean ran... Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. That's an election that should have been won. No no I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. You haven't hired anybody. And by the way I've hired and by the way I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You've hired nobody. You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards et cetera. So don't tell me about that. You haven't hired one person you liar. That's wrong. That's wrong. Totally wrong. I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands... Be quiet. Just be quiet. Let me talk. I've hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago it worked out very well. Everybody was happy. And by the way the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world. But I've hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody. I can only say this and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors because the audience is packed with them and they're packed with you. I've had an amazing relationship with politicians with politicians both Democrat Republican because I was a businessman. As one magazine said he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.You get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican you don't have one Republican senator and you work with them every day of your life although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you don't have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself. Here's a man Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs which is a total violation. He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks. Give me a break. . Correct. I will and the wall just got 10 feet taller believe me. It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you if I would have used even half of that word it would have been national scandal.This guy used a filthy disgusting word on television and he should be ashamed of himself and he should apologize OK? Number one. Number two we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.We're going to make them pay for that wall. Now the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion if I do it. If these guys do it it'll end up costing $200 billion. But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1000 you need 1000 miles. The Great Wall of China built 2000 years ago 2000 is 13000 miles. We need 1000 because we have a lot of natural barriers.We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion and it's a real wall. This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at. This is a wall that's going to work.Mexico will pay for it because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to... ... immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico. Well you know I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year you want to know the truth. We're losing so much. We're losing so much with Mexico and China with China we're losing $500 billion a year. And then people say ""don't we want to trade?"" I don't mind trading but I don't want to lose $500 billion. I don't want to lose $58 billion.Mexico just took Carrier Corporation maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. They're building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore which is true by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. They're taking our businesses. I don't mind. Such a cute sound bite. All right you know what? Because they devalue their currency they devalue their currencies... ... that makes it well you don't know a thing about business. You lose on everything... Let me just tell you they de-value their currency. They de-value their currencies. That makes it well you don't know a thing about business. You lose on everything you do. Let me just tell you they de-value their currencies. China Mexico everybody. Japan with the cars. They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them our workers lose their jobs... But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman. No I and you know why? You know why? You know why? First of all... ... first of all that's called a... And by the way and by the way... ... and by the way... ... I've won most of the lawsuits. And they actually did a very good job but I've won most of the lawsuits. Excuse me. Hey Wolf let me ask you. Am I allowed to respond to this? OK. Well let no I haven't. I really haven't. Here's a guy here's a guy that buys a house for $179000 he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380000 and then legislation is passed. You tell me about this guy. This is what we're going to have as president. No no no. I took... That is so wrong. We'll work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion. I borrowed $1 million... I borrowed $1 million I turned it into $10 billion... ... more than $10 billion. I have to say he lied this time. He lied. 100 percent. 100 percent. Yes yes yes. 38 years ago. True. True. No. First of all I don't believe anything Telemundo says. Number one. Number two I currently employ thousands of Hispanics and over the years I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. They're incredible people. They know and the reason I won in Nevada not only won the big one but I also won subs like as an example I won with women. I won with every single category. I won with men I won with high-income low-income I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China from Japan from so many other places.They get it. They're incredible people. They're incredible workers. They get it. And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics. I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll.But one thing I'm also going to do I'm going to be getting bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats who are independents and you're seeing that with the polls because if you look at anywhere look at any of the elections every single election it has been record-setting.And the good news is for the Republican Party the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in. We're getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that.We're getting record-setting numbers. And I won every one the three of them that I won I won with record-setting numbers. New people are coming into the Republican Party. We are building a new Republican Party a lot of new people are coming in. I love them. I love them. They're fine. Do you know what? They're fine. Why did they take the poll? Why did they... I'm just telling you I'm doing very well with Hispanics. And by the way I settled my suit as you know with Univision. It was settled. We're good friends now. It was all settled up. Very happy very happy. Very good people.I'm just telling you I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics. I will do better than anybody on this stage. I have respect for the people on the stage but I will do very well with Hispanics. But I'm telling you also I'm bringing people Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over and we're building a much bigger much stronger Republican Party. Yes I would. And I've been there. And I've been there very strongly. I do have to say something and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault. It's not Ted's fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare. That is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge. But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way no way that he should have approved Obamacare.Now with that being said these are the things that happen. But Ted very very strongly pushed Judge Roberts and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want. Well let let me let me just say let me just say this. Look I watched Ted and I respected it but he gets nowhere stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days and talk and talk and talk. I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted he left the Senate floor and they went back to work. OK? We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that. Now Ted's been very critical I have a sister who's a brilliant... ... excuse me. She's a brilliant judge. He's been criticizing he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito a very conservative member of the Supreme Court with my sister signed that bill. So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted. What do you think? When you say crazy zealot are you talking about you? Crazy zealot give me a break. Well let let me just say let me just say first of all I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative more importantly he was a great president. A great president. As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned I'm pro-life. I'm totally against abortion having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women cervical cancer breast cancer are helped by Planned Parenthood.So you can say whatever you want but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldn't fund it.I would defund it because of the abortion factor which they say is 3 percent. I don't know what percentage it is. They say it's 3 percent. But I would defund it because I'm pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood. I just want to say I agree with that 100 percent except pre-existing conditions I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We're going to have something much better but pre-existing conditions when I'm referring to that and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper I want to keep pre- existing conditions. I think we need it. I think it's a modern age. And I think we have to have it. I think they're wrong 100 percent. What we need look the insurance companies take care of the politicians. The insurance companies get what they want. We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition. We thought that was gone we thought those lines were going to be gone so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved and all of that was thrown out the window.The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people and insurance lobbyists and special interests. They got I'm not going to point to these gentlemen of course they're part of the problem other than Ben in all. Texas is the biggest prize next Tuesday Super Tuesday when 11 states vote a day that will go a long way towards deciding who wins the Republican nomination.We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. This debate is airing on CNN CNN International and CNN in Espanol. It's also being seen on Telemundo and heard on the Salem Radio Network. Telemundo and Salem are our partners in this debate along with the Republican National Committee.We'd also like to welcome a very special guest with us here tonight.

You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards et cetera. So don't tell me about that. You haven't hired one person you liar. That's wrong. That's wrong. Totally wrong. I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands... Be quiet. Just be quiet. Let me talk. I've hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago it worked out very well. Everybody was happy. And by the way the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world. But I've hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody. I can only say this and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors because the audience is packed with them and they're packed with you. I've had an amazing relationship with politicians with politicians both Democrat Republican because I was a businessman. As one magazine said he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.You get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican you don't have one Republican senator and you work with them every day of your life although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you don't have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself. Here's a man Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs which is a total violation. He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks. Give me a break. . Correct. I will and the wall just got 10 feet taller believe me. It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you if I would have used even half of that word it would have been national scandal.This guy used a filthy disgusting word on television and he should be ashamed of himself and he should apologize OK? Number one. Number two we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.We're going to make them pay for that wall. Now the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion if I do it. If these guys do it it'll end up costing $200 billion. But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1000 you need 1000 miles. The Great Wall of China built 2000 years ago 2000 is 13000 miles. We need 1000 because we have a lot of natural barriers.We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion and it's a real wall. This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at. This is a wall that's going to work.Mexico will pay for it because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to... ... immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico. Well you know I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year you want to know the truth. We're losing so much. We're losing so much with Mexico and China with China we're losing $500 billion a year. And then people say ""don't we want to trade?"" I don't mind trading but I don't want to lose $500 billion. I don't want to lose $58 billion.Mexico just took Carrier Corporation maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. They're building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore which is true by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. They're taking our businesses. I don't mind. Such a cute sound bite. All right you know what? Because they devalue their currency they devalue their currencies... ... that makes it well you don't know a thing about business. You lose on everything... Let me just tell you they de-value their currency. They de-value their currencies. That makes it well you don't know a thing about business. You lose on everything you do. Let me just tell you they de-value their currencies. China Mexico everybody. Japan with the cars. They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them our workers lose their jobs... But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman. No I and you know why? You know why? You know why? First of all... ... first of all that's called a... And by the way and by the way... ... and by the way... ... I've won most of the lawsuits. And they actually did a very good job but I've won most of the lawsuits. Excuse me. Hey Wolf let me ask you. Am I allowed to respond to this? OK. Well let no I haven't. I really haven't. Here's a guy here's a guy that buys a house for $179000 he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380000 and then legislation is passed. You tell me about this guy. This is what we're going to have as president. No no no. I took... That is so wrong. We'll work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion. I borrowed $1 million... I borrowed $1 million I turned it into $10 billion... ... more than $10 billion. I have to say he lied this time. He lied. 100 percent. 100 percent. Yes yes yes. 38 years ago. True. True. No. First of all I don't believe anything Telemundo says. Number one. Number two I currently employ thousands of Hispanics and over the years I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. They're incredible people. They know and the reason I won in Nevada not only won the big one but I also won subs like as an example I won with women. I won with every single category. I won with men I won with high-income low-income I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China from Japan from so many other places.They get it. They're incredible people. They're incredible workers. They get it. And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics. I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll.But one thing I'm also going to do I'm going to be getting bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats who are independents and you're seeing that with the polls because if you look at anywhere look at any of the elections every single election it has been record-setting.And the good news is for the Republican Party the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in. We're getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that.We're getting record-setting numbers. And I won every one the three of them that I won I won with record-setting numbers. New people are coming into the Republican Party. We are building a new Republican Party a lot of new people are coming in. I love them. I love them. They're fine. Do you know what? They're fine. Why did they take the poll? Why did they... I'm just telling you I'm doing very well with Hispanics. And by the way I settled my suit as you know with Univision. It was settled. We're good friends now. It was all settled up. Very happy very happy. Very good people.I'm just telling you I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics. I will do better than anybody on this stage. I have respect for the people on the stage but I will do very well with Hispanics. But I'm telling you also I'm bringing people Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over and we're building a much bigger much stronger Republican Party. Yes I would. And I've been there. And I've been there very strongly. I do have to say something and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault. It's not Ted's fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare. That is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge. But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way no way that he should have approved Obamacare.Now with that being said these are the things that happen. But Ted very very strongly pushed Judge Roberts and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want. Well let let me let me just say let me just say this. Look I watched Ted and I respected it but he gets nowhere stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days and talk and talk and talk. I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted he left the Senate floor and they went back to work. OK? We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that. Now Ted's been very critical I have a sister who's a brilliant... ... excuse me. She's a brilliant judge. He's been criticizing he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito a very conservative member of the Supreme Court with my sister signed that bill. So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted. What do you think? When you say crazy zealot are you talking about you? Crazy zealot give me a break. Well let let me just say let me just say first of all I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative more importantly he was a great president. A great president. As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned I'm pro-life. I'm totally against abortion having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women cervical cancer breast cancer are helped by Planned Parenthood.So you can say whatever you want but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldn't fund it.I would defund it because of the abortion factor which they say is 3 percent. I don't know what percentage it is. They say it's 3 percent. But I would defund it because I'm pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood. I just want to say I agree with that 100 percent except pre-existing conditions I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We're going to have something much better but pre-existing conditions when I'm referring to that and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper I want to keep pre- existing conditions. I think we need it. I think it's a modern age. And I think we have to have it. I think they're wrong 100 percent. What we need look the insurance companies take care of the politicians. The insurance companies get what they want. We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition. We thought that was gone we thought those lines were going to be gone so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved and all of that was thrown out the window.The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people and insurance lobbyists and special interests. They got I'm not going to point to these gentlemen of course they're part of the problem other than Ben in allaction. Black lives matter and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system and to address race relations in our country."
2016-02-25 00:00:00,arrars," Senator Rubio last week you said that on your first day in office you will get rid of President Obama's executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA for short. It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants. This is the only home they know and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish and I'm going to quote you which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point but it wouldn't be fair to cancel it immediately. So Senator Rubio what changed? Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One? Senator Senator... ... but you went you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One. Senator Rubio you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English. So in what sense did he lie? Let Senator Cruz jump in. Senator Cruz you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage. As a matter of fact you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary. And yet there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan the best platform to help them that you two are spending the time arguing with each other. Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.So my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base? ... Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich after the... Governor Kasich after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos. Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy report that concluded and I'm going to quote it ""if hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn't want them in the United States they won't pay attention to our next sentence."" So do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it? Dr. Carson concerning this recommendation of the report are you as a candidate getting it? The first part of the question is there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party certain things needed to happen. And one of them was that they shouldn't feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States otherwise they wouldn't pay attention to one more sentence from candidates. Mr. Trump it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race. You keep saying that Hispanics love you. And yes you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada. But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you. They don't like you. Wouldn't that make you an unelectable... ... candidate in a general election? You used to say that you love... For the record you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past. But it is not just a Telemundo poll. We have... All right. Well it's not the only poll. Just last night let me let me finish please. Just last night The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you. And concerning the Nevada victory allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample statistically insignificant of only about 100 let me finish please of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada. I am making reference I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election. Senator Rubio last week you said that on your first day in office you will get rid of President Obama's executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA for short.

2016-02-25 00:00:00,rubio," Well thank you. This election we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century but as part of this primary we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement. Thirty-six years ago Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush began the Reagan Revolution. For a generation they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense. But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams. Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears.I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history. Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama's. He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check paying a fine and paying taxes. Are those claims correct? Well first of all and before we do anything I've been abundantly clear on this. When I'm president of the United States before we do anything on immigration we are going to secure the border. And that's not just the physical border with Mexico it's Visa overstays. That's 45 percent of the problem right there. It also has to do that's why we need e-verify and entry-exit tracking system and so-forth. And until that happens we're not doing anything else. And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support.And Donald mentioned because he mentioned me in his answer that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate. Well the truth is though that a lot of these positions that he's now taking are new to him.In 2011 he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship. In 2012 Donald criticized Mitt Romney saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.And so even today we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.My mom and dad my mom was a maid at a hotel and instead of hiring an American like her you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.So I think this is an important issue. And I think we are realizing increasingly that it's an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years but finally needs to be solved once and for all. That my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation. You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election. And I think people in Florida would be surprised because in fact the article that was today they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs if you would have been willing to hire them to do it. No he... Well in fact I agree we should have won and I wished we would have but in fact you did criticize him for using the term ""self-deportation."" I mean that's on the record and people can look it up right now online. But again I just want to reiterate I think it's really important this point. I think it's fine it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas a huge issue for the country.But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign that you acknowledge that for example you're only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.You hired some workers from Poland... In fact some of the people... Yes you've hired a thousand from another country... Let me just say let me finish the statement. This is important. He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from... That's a fact. People can look it up. I'm sure people are Googling it right now. Look it up. ""Trump Polish workers"" you'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it. That happened. Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans. You paid a million dollars. Yeah a couple points. If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it. The second... But it no it's not a sound bite. It's a fact. Again go online and Google it. Donald Trump Polish workers. You'll see it. The second thing about the trade war I don't understand because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits. Why don't you make them in America? Well then make them in America. Well make them in America. Well then make them in America. Well make them in America. And so you make them in China and in Russia. Well I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies. You've bankrupted.. I don't know anything about... ... starting a university and that was a fake university. There are people who borrowed $36000... ... to go to Trump University and they're suing now $36000 to go to a university... ... that's a fake school. And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump... That's what they got for $36000. Most of the lawsuits. He's talked through the whole thing. Here's a guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadn't inherited $200 million you know where Donald Trump would be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan. That's where he would be. Oh OK. One million. Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made. Oh he doesn't make that money. Correct. It didn't change. No it's the same policy. It will have to end at some moment and as I said we will we will eliminate that executive order. The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. And it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2 someone who came here when they were 2 years old. I understand. I know people that are personally impacted by this. The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesn't have the power to do that. And he himself admitted that. I'm sorry but let me finish my... No but this is not about deportation. Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation. This is about DACA. DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional. I will cancel it on my first day in office which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire and new people will not be allowed to apply for them. Now I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional. No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis. Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA. I am going to get rid of DACA. In the Spanish interview you just read out the transcript in Spanish I said it will have to end at some point. That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it. And new people will not be able to apply. In fact I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now. That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it when the program expires they cannot renew it and it goes away. But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office. You lied about the Polish workers. You lied to the students at Trump University. Oh he lied 38 years ago. All right I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies. That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol. What I said is that ethanol will phase out it is phasing out now. By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law and at that point it will go away. I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we're just going to yank it away from them. And again you read the statement in Spanish. I said very clearly on Spanish television DACA will have to end at some point and that point is at that time I was not a candidate for president. I said it will end in my first day in office as president and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it. New applicants will not be able to apply. That is the end of DACA.I am sympathetic to this cause but once again it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates. I'm sorry I was mentioned... Maria I was mentioned in that. I was mentioned in that statement. ... OK. I was mentioned just because of the hispanic and I'll be brief. A couple points number one I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin and an African American. We are the party of diversity not the Democratic party. And the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.Yes it's an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it. But I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community as it is in every immigrant community is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself... ...and you can only do that through free enterprise. That's what we stand for not socialism like Bernie Sanders and increasingly Hillary Clinton. Well I think you ask a very important question because the issue here the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy. Justice Scalia in the history of the republic there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia plus there may be at least two other vacancies.So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would and he says that he would. But the bottom line is if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years on issue after issue he has not been on our side.Now if he's changed we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement. But the bottom line is that if you don't have a record there to look at and say ""I feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues.""In fact very recently he was still defending Planned Parenthood. He says he's not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel. These are concerning things.And so yes I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump if he becomes president will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia. The individual mandate. He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it which I don't believe that should be part of it. That should not remain there. I think here's what we need to replace it with. We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again. If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.Otherwise your employers can provide you health care money tax- free not treated as income and you can use that money only for health care but you can use it to fund health care any way you want fully fund a health savings account the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.And if you don't have that then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. And that I think is a much better approach than Obamacare which by the way isn't just bad for health care it's bad for our economy. It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off cut people's hours move people to part-time. It is not just a bad health care law it is a job-killing law. And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans. Well thank you. This election we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century but as part of this primary we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement. Thirty-six years ago Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush began the Reagan Revolution. For a generation they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense. But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams. Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears.I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history.

No he... Well in fact I agree we should have won and I wished we would have but in fact you did criticize him for using the term ""self-deportation."" I mean that's on the record and people can look it up right now online. But again I just want to reiterate I think it's really important this point. I think it's fine it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas a huge issue for the country.But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign that you acknowledge that for example you're only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.You hired some workers from Poland... In fact some of the people... Yes you've hired a thousand from another country... Let me just say let me finish the statement. This is important. He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from... That's a fact. People can look it up. I'm sure people are Googling it right now. Look it up. ""Trump Polish workers"" you'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it. That happened. Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans. You paid a million dollars. Yeah a couple points. If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it. The second... But it no it's not a sound bite. It's a fact. Again go online and Google it. Donald Trump Polish workers. You'll see it. The second thing about the trade war I don't understand because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits. Why don't you make them in America? Well then make them in America. Well make them in America. Well then make them in America. Well make them in America. And so you make them in China and in Russia. Well I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies. You've bankrupted.. I don't know anything about... ... starting a university and that was a fake university. There are people who borrowed $36000... ... to go to Trump University and they're suing now $36000 to go to a university... ... that's a fake school. And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump... That's what they got for $36000. Most of the lawsuits. He's talked through the whole thing. Here's a guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadn't inherited $200 million you know where Donald Trump would be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan. That's where he would be. Oh OK. One million. Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made. Oh he doesn't make that money. Correct. It didn't change. No it's the same policy. It will have to end at some moment and as I said we will we will eliminate that executive order. The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. And it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2 someone who came here when they were 2 years old. I understand. I know people that are personally impacted by this. The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesn't have the power to do that. And he himself admitted that. I'm sorry but let me finish my... No but this is not about deportation. Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation. This is about DACA. DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional. I will cancel it on my first day in office which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire and new people will not be allowed to apply for them. Now I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional. No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis. Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA. I am going to get rid of DACA. In the Spanish interview you just read out the transcript in Spanish I said it will have to end at some point. That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it. And new people will not be able to apply. In fact I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now. That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it when the program expires they cannot renew it and it goes away. But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office. You lied about the Polish workers. You lied to the students at Trump University. Oh he lied 38 years ago. All right I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies. That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol. What I said is that ethanol will phase out it is phasing out now. By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law and at that point it will go away. I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we're just going to yank it away from them. And again you read the statement in Spanish. I said very clearly on Spanish television DACA will have to end at some point and that point is at that time I was not a candidate for president. I said it will end in my first day in office as president and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it. New applicants will not be able to apply. That is the end of DACA.I am sympathetic to this cause but once again it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates. I'm sorry I was mentioned... Maria I was mentioned in that. I was mentioned in that statement. ... OK. I was mentioned just because of the hispanic and I'll be brief. A couple points number one I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin and an African American. We are the party of diversity not the Democratic party. And the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.Yes it's an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it. But I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community as it is in every immigrant community is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself... ...and you can only do that through free enterprise. That's what we stand for not socialism like Bernie Sanders and increasingly Hillary Clinton. Well I think you ask a very important question because the issue here the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy. Justice Scalia in the history of the republic there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia plus there may be at least two other vacancies.So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would and he says that he would. But the bottom line is if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years on issue after issue he has not been on our side.Now if he's changed we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement. But the bottom line is that if you don't have a record there to look at and say ""I feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues.""In fact very recently he was still defending Planned Parenthood. He says he's not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel. These are concerning things.And so yes I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump if he becomes president will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia. The individual mandate. He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it which I don't believe that should be part of it. That should not remain there. I think here's what we need to replace it with. We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again. If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.Otherwise your employers can provide you health care money tax- free not treated as income and you can use that money only for health care but you can use it to fund health care any way you want fully fund a health savings account the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.And if you don't have that then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. And that I think is a much better approach than Obamacare which by the way isn't just bad for health care it's bad for our economy. It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off cut people's hours move people to part-time. It is not just a bad health care law it is a job-killing law. And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans."
2016-02-25 00:00:00,blitzer," We're live here at the University of Houston for the 10th Republican presidential debate. An enthusiastic crowd is on hand here in the beautiful opera house at the Moore School of Music. Texas is the biggest prize next Tuesday Super Tuesday when 11 states vote a day that will go a long way towards deciding who wins the Republican nomination.We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. This debate is airing on CNN CNN International and CNN in Espanol. It's also being seen on Telemundo and heard on the Salem Radio Network. Telemundo and Salem are our partners in this debate along with the Republican National Committee.We'd also like to welcome a very special guest with us here tonight. Ladies and gentlemen the 41st president of the United States George Herbert Walker Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush. Everyone here is looking forward to a lively debate. I'll be your moderator tonight. Joining me in the questioning Telemundo host Maria Celesta Arrasas CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash; and Salem Radio Network's Hugh Hewitt who worked in the Reagan administration for six years.Tonight there are five Republican candidates and they're ready to join us right now.Please welcome Ohio Governor John Kasich. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Businessman and real estate developer Donald Trump. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. And retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson. Ladies and gentlemen welcome the Republican candidates for president of the United States. Now please rise for our national anthem performed by country music artist Deana Carter. Thank you very much Deana Carter. A beautiful beautiful national anthem. The final debate before Super Tuesday begins right after this quick break. Welcome back to the University of Houston and the Republican presidential debate. The candidates they are now in place. Their positions were selected based on their standing in the delegate race through Nevada with the top candidate in the center and the others extending outward.I want to tell you how tonight's debate will work. As moderator I will guide the discussion asking questions and follow-ups as will Maria Celeste Dana Bash and Hugh Hewitt. Candidates you'll have a minute and 15 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. We have timing lights that are visible to the candidates. Those lights will warn you when your time is up and as the candidates requested a bell will sound like this. We know you all want to jump and debate these critically important issues but please wait until you're called on. These are the rules all of the candidates have agreed to.It's time for the candidates to introduce themselves right now. You'll each have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson you're first. Governor Kasich? Senator Rubio? Senator Cruz? Mr. Trump. Thank you very much. It's now time to begin questions. Voters in the first four states have spoken and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet Super Tuesday. When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded and the biggest prize of the night is Texas. Immigration is a key issue in this state for all voters nationwide including the many people watching us on Telemundo. So that's where we begin.Mr. Trump you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. You've also promised to let what you call ""the good ones"" come back in. Your words ""the good ones"" after they've been deported.Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in. He says that's the biggest difference between the two of you. He calls your plan amnesty. Is it? Senator Cruz what's wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls ""the good ones"" come back to the United States? Mr. Trump do you want to respond to that? Senator Rubio? Mr. Trump? Thank you. Senator Cruz you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States. What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan? Mr. Trump? Senator Cruz? All right. We're going to move on to Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich... You can respond but let me get Governor Kasich in. He's been waiting patiently. Governor Kasich the idea you've said this and I want to quote you now: ""The idea that we're going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it."" Those are your words. Should people be allowed to break the law just because it's not feasible to stop them? Thank you Governor. Dr. Carson you've been critical of mass deportation. You said back in November you don't think Mr. Trump's plan necessarily represents the Republican Party. Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters do you still believe that? Thank you Dr. Carson. Mr. Trump your campaign as you well remember began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border. It's about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now. You've said the Mexican government will pay for it. The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen. The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen. In fact the former president of Mexico Vicente Fox he said today and I'm quoting him he said ""I'm not going to pay for that"" quote ""effing wall."" So if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion whatever it will cost how are you going to make them pay for the wall? If the if the Mexicans don't pay for the wall will you start a trade war with Mexico? Thank you. Senator Rubio? One at a time. One at a time. Hold on. One at a time Mr. Trump. All right I want to move on. Mr. Trump Senator I want to bring in... ... I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste. You're allowed you've been responding. Thank you. Thank you. I want to bring in Maria Celeste Arrars of Telemundo. Maria? Mr. Trump thank you. I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people the United States Supreme Court where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue. I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host Hugh Hewitt.Hugh? Thank you Dr. Carson. All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare so let's talk about your plans specific plans to replace it. I want to bring in our chief political correspondent Dana Bash. Now please rise for our national anthem performed by country music artist Deana Carter. Thank you very much Deana Carter.

2016-02-25 00:00:00,carson, If someone had tried to describe today's America to you 30 years ago you would have listened in disbelief. Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction secondary to divisiveness fiscal irresponsibility and failure to lead. Marco Donald Ted John we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other. What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight. It's not about us it's about the American people. I believe in liberty and justice for all. I think everything that we do should be fair. And I've already described you know how we can secure the border. We need to secure all the borders because it's not just people coming in from South America and Mexico but there are terrorists who want to destroy us who are getting across our borders fairly easily. And we have to stop that.But in terms of the people who are here already after we after we stop the illegal immigration we need to be reasonable. And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker assuming that they have an acceptable record.They have to pay a back-tax penalty have to pay taxes going forward but they don't have to live underground anymore. And I think they do not become American citizens they do not vote.If they want to become an American citizen they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through. I think that's the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.And we have other ways of of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there so that they don't feel the need to come over here. That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China paying interest on it. I didn't hear the first part of the question? OK well first of all let me just mention that last year at the NALEO the National Association for Latino Elected Officials I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there. And the reason that I don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group. You know this is America. And we need to have policies that are that give liberty and justice to all people.And that's the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy looking at that. And I think that's the way the Republican Party generally thinks. We don't pick and choose winners and losers. We are compassionate.But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America. When we begin to emphasize that I think we will attract everybody. Well first of all let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia. I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago. A tremendous wit and intellect. As far as religious freedom is concerned one of the basic tenets of this nation and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights. And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights nobody get extra rights. So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it. That's unfair.And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done. That's why we have divided government. And we're going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way or we will lose our religious freedom.And as president I would go through and I would look at what a person's life has been. What have they done in the past? What kind of judgments have they made? What kind of associations do they have? That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.

2016-02-25 00:00:00,cruz," Welcome to Texas. Here Texas provided my family with hope. Here my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college. Here my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas. I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here. When I ran for Senate I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day and not for the Washington bosses.And I'll tell you as I travel the state Democrats tell me I didn't vote for you but you're doing what you said you would do. And as president I will do the same. You know the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs. Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down. You know in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona. Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state and what's happened there it was a very interesting article.Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare on prisons and education all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. And the Americans and for that matter the legal immigrants who are in Arizona are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. That's who we need to be fighting for.Listen we have always welcomed legal immigrants but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens and that's why I've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally and that's why I will do the same thing as president. Well existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. That's existing law. But let me say Wolf I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty promising to fight to build a wall. And in 2013 when I was fight against the ""gang of eight"" amnesty bill where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on ""Celebrity Apprentice."" And indeed if you look at the ""gang of eight"" one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill.If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight Donald gave over $50000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when you're funding open border politicians you shouldn't be surprised when they fight for open borders.And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty. And I'm the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him. You know I actually think Donald is right. He is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington. And he's right. He has supported he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be hiring illegal immigrants. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn't be funding the Gang of Eight. And you know he is right. When you stand up to Washington when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption enough with the cronyism let's actually stand for the working men and women of this country Washington doesn't like it. And Donald if you want to be liked in Washington that's not a good attribute for a president. Wolf can I respond to that attack? Well Maria I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate and you're right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that. You know we've both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal or unconstitutional program. Well it'll have to end some day not immediately but someday in the future.That inevitably is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all.You know I'm reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies. When I campaigned in Iowa I took on the lobbyists took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.Marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. Well someday it should end just not now. And frankly I think we need a president who knows what he believes in is willing to say it on day one not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem. Well Maria you are right. It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants. It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides. You know I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal. That makes sense in the media but I gotta tell you one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.At the same time Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. And the reason is as you know you look at the value sin the hispanic community. The values in our community are faith family patriotism.You know we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. And when I campaigned and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley defending conservative principles defending judeo- Christian principals telling my father's story.Telling my Dad's story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear not speaking English washing dishes having hopes and dreams for the American dream. And the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community. It is not working in the hispanic community and I... ...fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream. Well Hugh I agree with you that it Justice Scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election. Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. And with his passing the court is now hanging in the balance. We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution. Now I think the voters of Texas the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this this stage. In the past Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. So I'm certain if you took a survey everyone would say they would do that.But the reality is Democrats bat about 1000. Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. Republicans have batted worse than 500 more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.I've spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment they're asking the question: Who do you know beyond a shadow of a doubt who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? I give you my word every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours. Well listen Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts. Yes it's true I supported the Republican nominee once he was made. But I would not have nominated John Roberts. I would have nominated my former boss Mike Luttig who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals. And I'll tell you Hugh... ...you know it's interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who who will defend religious liberty but this is a man who for 40 years has given money to Jimmy Carter to Joe Biden to Hillary Clinton to Chuck Schumer to Harry Reid.Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington... ...and cut a deal. So that means on Supreme Court... ... he's going to look to cut a deal rather than fight for someone who won't cut a deal on the Constitution but will defend it faithfully. Let me tell you right now Donald I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution. I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights. And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is on religious liberty you can't have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it. You've got to be willing to cut a deal.And you know there is a reason why when Harry Reid was asked of all the people on this stage who does he want the most who does he like the most Harry Reid said Donald Donald Trump.Why? Because Donald has supported him in the past and he knows he can cut a deal with him. You know what Donald... ... I don't want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights. Welcome to Texas. Here Texas provided my family with hope. Here my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college. Here my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas. I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here. When I ran for Senate I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day and not for the Washington bosses.And I'll tell you as I travel the state Democrats tell me I didn't vote for you but you're doing what you said you would do. And as president I will do the same. You know the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs. Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down. You know in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona. Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state and what's happened there it was a very interesting article.Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare on prisons and education all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. And the Americans and for that matter the legal immigrants who are in Arizona are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. That's who we need to be fighting for.Listen we have always welcomed legal immigrants but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens and that's why I've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally and that's why I will do the same thing as president. Well existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. That's existing law. But let me say Wolf I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty promising to fight to build a wall. And in 2013 when I was fight against the ""gang of eight"" amnesty bill where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on ""Celebrity Apprentice."" And indeed if you look at the ""gang of eight"" one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill.If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight Donald gave over $50000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when you're funding open border politicians you shouldn't be surprised when they fight for open borders.And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty. And I'm the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him. You know I actually think Donald is right. He is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington. And he's right. He has supported he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be hiring illegal immigrants. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn't be funding the Gang of Eight. And you know he is right. When you stand up to Washington when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption enough with the cronyism let's actually stand for the working men and women of this country Washington doesn't like it. And Donald if you want to be liked in Washington that's not a good attribute for a president. Wolf can I respond to that attack? Well Maria I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate and you're right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that. You know we've both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal or unconstitutional program. Well it'll have to end some day not immediately but someday in the future.That inevitably is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all.You know I'm reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies. When I campaigned in Iowa I took on the lobbyists took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.Marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. Well someday it should end just not now. And frankly I think we need a president who knows what he believes in is willing to say it on day one not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem. Well Maria you are right. It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants. It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides. You know I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal. That makes sense in the media but I gotta tell you one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.At the same time Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. And the reason is as you know you look at the value sin the hispanic community. The values in our community are faith family patriotism.You know we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. And when I campaigned and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley defending conservative principles defending judeo- Christian principals telling my father's story.Telling my Dad's story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear not speaking English washing dishes having hopes and dreams for the American dream. And the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community. It is not working in the hispanic community and I... ...fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.

2016-02-25 00:00:00,kasich, Well you know on the way over here even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage you know my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother's mother was an immigrant could barely speak English. And I'm standing on this stage. It's pretty remarkable. But I want to tell you there's a lot of young people watching tonight. You can do whatever you want to do in your life. America is an amazing country where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight. So to all the young people that are out there your hopes your dreams pursue them. Shoot for the stars. America's great and you can do it. Thank you Wolf. Look we have a great president here George Bush the 41st president of the United States. He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem a path to legalization. You see that was a time when things worked. It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work. Look I think there is an answer here. The answer is you complete the border. You let people know that once it's done you don't have a right to come in. If you come in we don't want any excuse. You're going to go back. But I favor a guest worker program. I think it's practical. And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans the illegals that are here if they have not committed a crime since they've been here I'd make them pay a fine some back taxes maybe some community service. And at the end I'd give them a path to legalization but not a path to citizenship. I don't think we're going to tear families apart. I don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I don't think first of all I don't think it's practical and I don't think it reflects America.You know what happened? The problem with President Reagan is we didn't get in there and actually finish the border. And I think it was probably business interests that affected it. But at the end of the day let's be practical. Let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. With President Reagan and George Bush it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue and I think we can and should do it again. And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us. Well I'm not going to talk about that. I mean I've got to tell you I was with this little 12-year-old girl was at a town hall meeting and she said you know I don't like all this yelling and screaming at the debates. My mother's thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore. I think we ought to move beyond that about what they think. I'm going to tell you what I think. My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. I haven't changed anything with it.And look my view is we need economic growth. Everything starts with economic growth. And how do you get it? Common sense regulations lower taxes for both business and individuals and of course a fiscal plan that balances the budget.That gives you economic growth. I did it when I was in Washington as the Budget Committee chairman negotiating actually with Democrats that gave us surpluses economic growth and the same thing in Ohio.But here's the thing that I believe. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.Of course our friends in the Hispanic community our friends in the African-American community the promise of America is that our system when we follow the right formula is going to give opportunity for everyone.It's what Jack Kemp used to say. A rising tide lifts all boats not just some boats but all boats. And you know what? With me and the Hispanic community I think they like me. And I appreciate that because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.It's time to solve problems. Well you know  of course. I mean if look I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church. Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in. No question and no doubt about it. Now in regard to same-sex marriage I don't favor it. I've always favored traditional marriage but look the court has ruled and I've moved on. And what I've said Hugh is that look where does it end?If you're in the business of selling things if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with OK today I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay and tomorrow maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced.I mean if you're in the business of commerce conduct commerce. That's my view. And if you don't agree with their lifestyle say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.But when it comes to the religious institutions they are in inviolate in my mind and I would fight for those religious institutions. And look I've appointed over a hundred judges as governor. I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.And you know what they are? They're conservatives. Go check it out. They are conservatives. They don't make the law. They interpret the law. That's all they do. And they stick by the Constitution. So I will do that.But let's just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that. I think my position is clear. Well you know on the way over here even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage you know my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother's mother was an immigrant could barely speak English. And I'm standing on this stage. It's pretty remarkable. But I want to tell you there's a lot of young people watching tonight. You can do whatever you want to do in your life.

2016-02-25 00:00:00,bash, Senator Rubio you said yesterday right here in Houston that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good. So he says he is going to repeal Obamacare. Are you saying that you're worried he won't? Mr. Trump Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate. Would you respond? OK so let's talk about pre-existing conditions. What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance. Are they wrong? Senator Rubio you said yesterday right here in Houston that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good. So he says he is going to repeal Obamacare. Are you saying that you're worried he won't?

2016-02-25 00:00:00,hewitt, Thank you Wolf. To me it's the most important issue. I'll start with you Senator Cruz. Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices? Mr. Trump Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night which is religious liberty. Churches Catholic and Christian colleges Catholic adoption agencies all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby if it's repealed it was a five-four decision they're going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills. They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded they will lose their tax exemption. Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint not just to the Supreme Court but to all courts? Ted Cruz Senator the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right but what do you make of Mr. Cruz's criticism? Mr. Trump... ... can I... Can I trust you on religious liberty? Mr. Cruz will you make a deal about religious liberty? Let me Senator. Senator Rubio. Senator Rubio you've heard this exchange on religious liberty. You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages not provide flowers not provide baked goods et cetera. Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty? Mr. Trump? Governor Kasich back to religious liberty. You've been a little bit less emphatic. You've said same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker sell them a cupcake. Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people? Dr. Carson let me wrap it up with you. Are their positions clear? Are the positions you've heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom? Thank you Wolf. To me it's the most important issue. I'll start with you Senator Cruz. Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices? Mr. Trump Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night which is religious liberty. Churches Catholic and Christian colleges Catholic adoption agencies all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby if it's repealed it was a five-four decision they're going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills.

2016-03-03 00:00:00,unidentifiable, 
2016-03-03 00:00:00,baier," 59 Republican delegates are at stake here in the state of Michigan during next Tuesday's Republican primary the biggest prize out of four states holding contests that day. For tonight's debate we're partnering with Facebook. The conversation about this election has been intense as the crowd is here. Since January 1st 53 million people in the U.S. have been talking about the election on Facebook. So pleasant. We have a big crowd here and while we expect the audience to be enthusiastic and responsive at times... ... they may have already been we also expect them to be respectful and we want the candidates to get their full time. So somewhere between a library and a Red Wings game. Am I right? Is that OK?Let's get started. Senator Rubio three weeks ago you said quote: ""I don't do the personal attacks primarily because it's not who I am because I think it's beneath the office that I'm seeking but also because I don't want to embarrass my kids."" But in the past week you've mocked Mr. Trump's tan. You've made fun of his spelling. You called him a con artist. You suggested he wet himself backstage at the last debate along with other vulgar jokes and jabs. So what happened? Mr. Trump your response? OK. Moving on. Governor Kasich today you admitted that you have a narrow path to the nomination through a contested convention. Today also Mitt Romney proposed that Republicans should vote for Senator Rubio in Florida. They should vote for you in Ohio. They should vote for Senator Cruz in states that he can beat Mr. Trump to prevent Mr. Trump from getting the nomination. So do you buy Romney's blueprint and can you say tonight to your Florida supporters that they should vote for Senator Rubio to get a contested convention? ... But Governor this is all about process. For voters they need to see a path to get to the nomination if they're going to support you. On Super Tuesday you finished in single digits in nine out of 11 states. So you can see that your path is through a contested convention. How do you... Thank you. Coming up more with Megyn on immigration plus questions on other top issues including the war on terror. The ""FOX News Republican Presidential Debate Live from Detroit"" continues after a quick break. Gentlemen the next topic to discuss is terrorism. Senator Rubio ISIS is a big topic of conversation on Facebook. We have a map that shows the conservation about ISIS around the country. You proposed sending a larger number of American ground troops to help defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq... ... but military commanders say the biggest ISIS threat to Europe in particular now is coming from Libya not Syria. So just to be clear if you're for putting more U.S. ground troops in Iraq and Syria are you also ready to send U.S. ground troops on the ground in Libya? Governor Kasich would you put ground troops in Libya? Mr. Trump just yesterday almost 100 foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable. General Michael Hayden former CIA director NSA director and other experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises specifically targeting terrorists' families and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding the military will refuse because they've been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders. So what would you do as commander-in-chief if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders? But they're illegal. But targeting terrorists' families? Even targeting terrorists' families? Senator Cruz you were mentioned. Senator Cruz? But Senator Cruz in 2013 you said you were open you were open to the possibility that Edward Snowden had performed a considerable public service you said back then in revealing certain aspects of the NSA procedures. Many of your colleagues in the Senate including Senator Rubio called him a traitor. It took you until January of this year to call him a traitor and say he should be tried for treason. Why the change of heart? And why did it take you so long? Mr. Trump you've repeatedly deflected calls for specific national security or defense policy plans with the claim that you'll ask the best people when you become president and take their advice. So who are the best people? Can you reveal two or three names that you trust for national security? Governor Kasich thank you. Welcome back to the historic Fox Theater in downtown Detroit and the Republican presidential debate. Let's get right back to the questions. We are here in Detroit. The top issues in Michigan according to Facebook are displayed in a word cloud you're taking a look at. The second biggest issue is clean water. That of course is directly tied with the situation in Flint. Senator Rubio Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have both been to Flint. They are both running ads in this state focusing on that focusing on supporting Flint and fixing the problems showing images of people in Flint thankful that they're there.Without getting into the political blame game here where are the national Republicans' plans on infrastructure and solving problems like this? If you talk to people in this state they are really concerned about Flint on both sides of the aisle. So why haven't GOP candidates done more or talked more about this? Thank you Senator. Gentlemen the next series of questions will be on social issues. Governor Kasich the last debate you were asked a question about religious liberty in a hypothetical situation where a same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker to do their wedding. Here's what you said. Governor some faith leaders got nervous about that answer. Do gay marriage dissenters have rights? Senator Cruz the U.S. Supreme Court obviously declared same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states a decision you have criticized. Given the current status of the law do you believe a gay couple should be able to adopt? Senator thank you. Senator Cruz definitely avoided saying your name Mr. Trump but I think he was referring to you and your religious liberty answer. Would you like to respond? Senator Rubio the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia a conservative icon obviously pointed out in the United States versus Heller that like most rights the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. Just like the First Amendment doesn't allow you to go into a theater and yell fire he said the Second Amendment leaves room to regulate guns. So do you agree with Justice Scalia? And if so what limits would you draw around the Second Amendment? Mr. Trump you were once a supporter of an assault weapons ban. So do you think there should be any restrictions on the Second Amendment? But in 2000 you wrote in your book ""I generally oppose gun control but I support the ban on assault weapons."" Senator Cruz? Any limits to the Second Amendment? Mr. Trump... Quickly Senator Cruz. Gentlemen gentlemen we're going to move on. Thank you very much. We want to talk about some more policy questions coming up. Coming up a final question and closing statements. And take a look at this. The volume of conversation on Facebook surrounding the remaining candidates over the last month. Whether that conversation is good or bad Donald Trump clearly dominates the field. We'll be back with more of the Republican presidential debate live from Detroit. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate. Let's get back at it. Gentlemen this is the last question of the night. It has been a long time since our first debate seven months ago in Cleveland. A lot has transpired since then obviously including an RNC pledge that all of you signed agreeing to support the party's nominee and not to launch an independent run. Tonight in 30 seconds can you definitively say you will support the Republican nominee even if that nominee is Donald J. Trump?Senator Rubio yes or no? Mr. Trump? Yes or no? Senator... Senator Cruz yes or no you will support Donald Trump is he's the nominee? Governor Kasich yes or no would you support Donald Trump as the Republican nominee? But your answer is yes? Senator Cruz your closing statement?"
2016-03-03 00:00:00,trump," Well look he was a failed candidate he should have beaten president Obama very easy. He failed miserably and it was an embarrassment to everybody including the Republican party. It looked like he went away on a vacation the last month. So I don't take that and I guess obviously he wants to be relevant. He wants to be back in the game.As far as domestic policy and trade which is killing our country he said free trade and I believe in free trade also. But if you look at China and you look Japan and if you look at Mexico both at the border by the way where they're killing us.Both at the border and with trade and every other country we do business with we are getting absolutely crushed on trade. And he said free trade I say free trade great. But not when they're beating us so badly.With China we're going to lose $505 billion dollars in terms of trades. You just can't do it.Mexico $58 billion dollars.Japan probably about they don't know it yet but about $109 billion dollars.Every country we lose money with. As far as I'm concerned we've got to reduce we have to redo our trade deals 100 percent. I have the greatest business people in the world lined up to do it. We will make... ... great trade deals. I totally disavow the Klu Klux Klan. I totally disavow David Duke. I've been doing it now for two weeks this is your you're probably about the 18th person that's asked me the question. It was very clear that question was also talked about in the form of groups. Groups I want to know which groups are you talking about? You have to tell me which groups? Ultimately he got to the Klu Klux Klan which obviously I'm going to disavow. And by the way if you look on my Twitter account almost immediately after the program they were disavowed again.You know it's amazing. When I do something on Twitter everybody picks it up goes all over the place. But when I did this one nobody ever picks it up. Take a look at my Twitter account. Thank you. Thanks. And we will. Well I also happened to call him a lightweight OK? And I have said that. So I would like to take that back. He is really not that much of a lightweight. And as far as and I have to say this I have to say this. He hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this. Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands if they are small something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee. I have heard Ted say that over and over again on television that he is the only one that can beat me. Just for the record I have won 10. He has won three or four. Last week in fact on Tuesday I was a half a million votes higher than him. I was a million votes higher than Marco 1 million votes. That's a lot of votes. And was by far in first place. So I keep hearing that he is the only one that can beat me but he is getting beaten very very badly. So where does this come from? Where does it come from? Oh yeah you're... Very nice words but happens to be wrong. CNN just came out with a poll two days ago that... ... That national poll excuse me... ... The national poll a national poll where he's at 15 he's at 14... ... And I'm at 49 so when he says 75 percent that would mean that 80 percent of the people don't dig you and I'm back down to 50... Wrong... ... I beat Hillary Clinton. I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls... I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls... ... I think I'm talking... ... I beat Hillary Clinton... ... I hope you think ... ... I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls. The Cue poll just came out. I beat Hillary Clinton in a recent Fox poll I beat Hillary Clinton in USA Today I beat her today in a poll in Ohio. I beat I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton. I beat and I have not started on Hillary yet. Believe me I will... ... start soon. I haven't even started. ... In one poll... ... In one poll... Wrong. Wrong. This little guy has lied so much... ... about my record. He has lied so much about my record. And I will tell you this. First of all I got a call from my sister and brother tonight and they said we had no idea Dad gave you $200 million. Believe me I started off with $1 million. I built a company that's worth more than $10 billion. And I say it not in a bragging way but that's the kind of thinking we need. Very low debt tremendous cash flow. My financials are all they're all in there with the federal elections. You've seen them. Everybody has seen them. I say it only because that's the kind of thinking this country needs with $19 trillion in debit. Believe me. They devalue their currencies. I will do that. And by the way I have been doing it more and more. But they devalue their currencies in particular China. Mexico is doing a big number now also. Japan is unbelievable what they're doing. They devalue their currencies and they make it impossible for clothing-makers in this country to do clothing in this country. And if you look at what's happened on Seventh Avenue and you look at what's happened in New York with the garment industry so much of the clothing now comes out from Vietnam China and other places. And it's all because of devaluation.By the way the Trans-Pacific if you look at the TPP a total disaster which by the way Marco is in favor of they need it is a disaster for our country. It's trying to be approved by various people including President Obama. And I'll tell you something. The biggest problem with that is: They don't take into concurrence the devaluation. They're devaluing their currency. And they're killing they're going to... No no. I have very good answers. I know what's happening with the economy. You don't know a thing. You haven't employed in your life one person. I have employed tens of thousands of people. You haven't employed one person. Oh you know what? You know what? Take a look at Trump Steaks. By the way that's the other thing... Mitt Romney... ... false totally false. And now the funny thing is he didn't talk about the hundreds of really successful jobs the buildings all over the world that have made a fortune. I will. Don't worry about it Marco. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it little Marco I will. Don't worry about it little Marco. This guy has a number one the number one absentee record in the United States... He doesn't show up to vote. That's why the people in Florida do not like him. Correct. Department of Education. We're cutting Common Core. We're getting rid of Common Core. We're bringing education locally. Department of Environmental Protection. We are going to get rid are of it in almost every form. We're going to have little tidbits left but we're going to take a tremendous amount out. We have various other things. If you look at the IRS if you look at every single agency we can cut it down and I mean really cut it down and save. The waste fraud and abuse is massive.Larry Kudlow great guy everybody respects him said my plan for taxes and tax cutting is the best by far of everybody. OK. Let me explain something. Because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste. We don't bid properly. We don't have proper bidding procedures. The reason we don't is because they take care of all of the senators all of the congressman and they don't bid. They don't go out to bid. Take a look excuse me. You are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars... ... if we went out to the proper bid. Of course you are. I'm saying saving through negotiation throughout the economy you will save $300 billion a year. And that's a huge of course it is. We are going to buy things for less money. Of course it is. That works out... I'm not only talking about drugs I'm talking about other things. We will save $300 billion a year if we properly negotiate. We don't do that. We don't negotiate. We don't negotiate anything. Well all of a sudden I hear for 40 years I've been involved in Washington. I have been supporting people for many years. And these people have been politicians and they've been on both sides Democrats Republicans liberals conservatives. I've supported everybody because until recently I wasn't a politician and I hope maybe you don't all consider me a politician right now. I hate the term politician. But I've been supporting politicians. A recent article somewhere said Donald Trump is a world-class businessman who goes out and he does get along with everybody. I've supported Democrats and I've supported Republicans. And as a businessman I owed that to my company to my family to my workers to everybody to get along.Part of the problem we have in Washington Chris... ... is it's total gridlock. Nobody gets along. We need people to get along. We need to be able to get things done. Actually it was for business. It was. It was. It was for business. I pride myself including outside of the United States. I'm doing almost 120 deals outside of the which I hope to be able to stop very soon and let my children handle it but we're doing many many deals outside of the United States. I support politicians. In 2008 I supported Hillary Clinton. I supported many other people by the way. And that was because of the fact that I'm in business. I did support very heavily Ronald Reagan. I also supported George Bush by the way. Let me tell you something Ted. The last person that Hillary Clinton wants to face is Donald Trump. That I can... That I can tell you. Hello. Nice to be with you Megyn. You're looking well. You're looking well. I don't know exactly what when you talk about off the record. First of all Buzzfeed? They were the ones that said under no circumstances will I run for president. And were they wrong. But a lot of people said that. Then I did have a meeting with the editorial board of the New York Times a very nice meeting. Many of those things were off the record I think at their suggestion and my suggestion. And I think being off the record is a very important thing. I think it's a very very powerful thing.And I will say this. These three gentlemen have gone off the record many times with reporters. And I think they want to honor it and I would always honor that.I will say though in terms of immigration and almost anything else there always has to be some you know tug and pull and deal. And you know when I watch Ted stand on the Senate floor I had great respect for what he did. He stood there for a day-and-a- half or something. In the meantime what came of it? Nothing. You have to be able to have some flexibility some negotiation.Now sometimes you ask for more than you want and you negotiate down to the point. I may have discussed something like that with the New York Times but I would never release off-the-record conversations. I don't think it's fair frankly to do that to anybody. Not very flexible. No not very flexible. I give the example I'm going to build a wall. I'm the one that wants the wall. I'm the one that can build the wall. It's going to get built. And by the way Mexico is going to pay for the wall. I can tell you that. Mexico is going to pay for the wall. But and I used an example. And this isn't necessarily what was said but whatever was said the wall's 50 feet high. Is it going to be 45 feet or 40 feet? That could very well be. That could very well he wants it to be higher. That could very well be. But there's always give and take. There's always negotiation. And the best negotiator that knows what he's doing will make a great deal. But we need give and take in government. If you don't have give and take you're never going to agree on anything. Fine. I will say one thing what Marco said is I understand it. He is talking about a little give and take and a little negotiation. And you know what? That's OK. That's not the worst thing in the world. There is nothing wrong with that. I happen to be much stronger on illegal immigration. Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed me. And if he endorses you believe me you are the strongest from Arizona.But give and take is OK. And I thought what he said is OK. We may differ on the degree. But what he said to me is OK. No. I never do that. I would not do that. I don't think I have too much respect if I deal with you off the record if I deal with Bret or Chris off the record I have too much respect for that process to say just release everything. I would not do that. I'm changing. I'm changing. We need highly skilled people in this country and if we can't do it we'll get them in. But and we do need in Silicon Valley we absolutely have to have. So we do need highly skilled and one of the biggest problems we have is people go to the best colleges. They'll go to Harvard they'll go to Stanford they'll go to Wharton as soon as they're finished they'll get shoved out. They want to stay in this country. They want to stay here desperately they're not able to stay here. For that purpose we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country. ... I'm changing it and I'm softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country. ... That is correct. ... No I'm not playing. I'm not playing to anybody's fantasies I'm playing to the fact that our country is in trouble that we have a tremendous problem with crime. The border is a disaster it's like a piece of Swiss cheese. We're going to stop it we're going to stop people from coming into our country illegally. We're going to stop it. First of all I've had tens of thousands of people working for me most of which are 98 97 98 percent of the people in this country from this country. I'm very proud of it. You have a club in Palm Beach Florida called the Mar-a-Lago Club it's a very very successful club. It has a very short season it's called the Season and it goes from November until March. It's a few months five months at the most. People don't want a short-term job. They don't want so we will bring people in and we will send the people out. All done legally all done with the process that's... ...approved by government in Palm Beach or West Palm Beach. We bring people in we bring them out. We want to hire as many Americans as we can but they don't want part-time very short part-time jobs. ... Wrong... ... That's wrong. ... Wrong... ... Wrong... The the the other hotels during the season they do the same thing. They take in a lot of people because you can't get them. They take in a lot of people. Long-term employees we don't do that but short-term employees we have no choice but to do it and other hotels in that very very hot area. It is a very hot area. It's very very hard to get people. But other hotels do the exact same thing. And just so you understand just again this is a legal process. This is a procedure. It's part of the law. I take advantage of that. There's nothing wrong with it. We have no choice. This wasn't on the subject. Tapes were not on the subject but that's... No no. You're the liar. You're the lying guy up here. You're the you're the one. You're the one. You're the one. Now let me just tell you. Let me just tell you. Excuse me. Excuse me. I've given my answer Lyin' Ted. I've given my answer. They won't refuse. They're not going to refuse me. Believe me. Let me just tell you you look at the Middle East. They're chopping off heads. They're chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way. They're drowning people in steel cages. And he now we're talking about waterboarding. This really started with Ted a question was asked of Ted last two debates ago about waterboarding. And Ted was you know having a hard time with that question to be totally honest with you. They then came to me what do you think of waterboarding? I said it's fine. And if we want to go stronger I'd go stronger too because frankly... ...that's the way I feel. Can you imagine can you imagine these people these animals over in the Middle East that chop off heads sitting around talking and seeing that we're having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding. That's my opinion. And and and I'm a leader. I'm a leader. I've always been a leader. I've never had any problem leading people. If I say do it they're going to do it. That's what leadership is all about. Well look you know when a family flies into the World Trade Center a man flies into the World Trade Center and his family gets sent back to where they were going and I think most of you know where they went and by the way it wasn't Iraq but they went back to a certain territory they knew what was happening. The wife knew exactly what was happening. They left two days early with respect to the World Trade Center and they went back to where they went and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center flying into the Pentagon and probably trying to fly into the White House except we had some very very brave souls on that third plane. All right? I have no problem with it. I think Richard Haass is excellent. I have a lot of respect for him. I think General Keane is excellent. I think that there are I like Colonel Jacobs very much. I see him. I know him. I have many people that I think are really excellent but in the end it's going to be my decision. When you just asked the question about Snowden I will tell you right from the beginning I said he was a spy and we should get him back. And if Russia respected our country they would have sent him back immediately but he was a spy. It didn't take me a long time to figure that one out. Believe me.But I would get the best people people that I'd be comfortable with. And we will do the right thing. We've made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place. That thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave. Just as I said that Iraq was going to collapse after we leave. We made a mistake going into Iraq. I've never said we made a mistake... Well OK I never said that. OK. Wouldn't matter. I never said it. Should I respond to that first? You'll be here a long time. I hate the concept of it but on a humanitarian basis with what's happening you have to. It's living in Hell in Syria; there's no question about it. They're living in Hell. Look from a humanitarian standpoint I'd love to help but we have our own problems. We have so many problems that we have to solve. Well on Afghanistan I did mean Iraq. I think you have to stay in Afghanistan for a while because of the fact that you're right next to Pakistan which has nuclear weapons and we have to protect that. Nuclear weapons change the game. And I was always against going into Iraq. In fact I believe me I was always against it. There was some cases where I sort of in one interview with a great friend of mine and yours Howard Stern said that said that... I said very meekly long before we went in I said very meekly well maybe maybe I don't know. By the time it got to that point I was always against Iraq. But Afghanistan I felt and in that one if you notice I corrected it the second day. OK? Second question? No no. But... Now on let me explain that. You're right. Let me explain. First time the question had been put to me it was very early on. The migration had just started. And I had heard that the number was a very very small number. By the second day two or three days later I heard the number was going to be thousands and thousands of people. You know when they originally heard about it they were talking about bringing very very small numbers in.And I said begrudgingly well I guess maybe that's OK. It was not like ""Let's bring them in"" because I think we should build a safe zone in we should really what we should be doing is building safe zones so they can stay in their own country and not go all over and at least this way we're not going to have the problem. That's what we have to do. But just just to set because I fully understand what you're asking. When I first heard the question first time the question was ever asked to me first time I really had known about the question the migration had just started. I was very much like OK by the time I went back and studied it and they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands I changed my tune. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Megyn I have a very strong core. I have a very strong core. But I've never seen a successful person who wasn't flexible who didn't have a certain degree of flexibility. You have to have a certain degree of flexibility. You can't for instance let's say on on the second question you can't say it's OK and then you find out it's not OK and you don't want to do anything. You have to be flexible because you learn. I mean before I knew the question was asked by Bill and the next day or the couple of days later the question was asked by by you know I was asked by a number of people actually. I was asked by Sean but I was asked by a number of people. But by that time the number had increased significantly. The next day. But I had learned. I mean nobody had ever asked me the question. This was brand new. But and I really mean it. You have to show a degree of flexibility. If you're going to be one way and you think it's wrong does that mean the rest of your life you have to go in the wrong direction because you don't want to change?   ... That's not right... ... We'll find out when we have the ... ... And by the way just so you understand... ...this is a case I could have settled very easily but I don't settle cases very easily when I'm right. Ninety-eight percent approval rating we have an ""A"" from the Better Business Bureau... ... We have a 98 percent approval rating from the people who took the course. We have an ""A"" from the Better Business Bureau. And people like it. Now he's saying they didn't learn. We have many many people that will be witnesses. Again I don't settle cases. I don't do it because that's why I don't get sued very often because I don't settle unlike a lot of other people.We have a situation where we will win in court... ...But many of the people that are witnesses did tremendously well and made a lot of money... ... By taking the course. You're going to see you don't know... You're going to see you're going to see. ... No no. Before they had the information... ... Before they had the information... ... Before they had the information it got it is right now an ""A"" once they had the information... ... The only reason that is was a ""D"" was because we didn't care we didn't give them the information... ... When they got the information it became an ""A""... ... Marco you don't know ... ... Yes. ... ... But it was elevated to an ""A""... ... I can give it to you. I can give it to you tomorrow.. ... It was elevated to an ""A"". ... Small business... ... Right... ... The lead plaintiff is now getting out of the case because it's so bad for her... ... Excuse me the lead plaintiff signed a letter saying how great it was and it on tape saying how great it was. ... She's trying to get out of the case. She's trying to get out of the case... Oh give me a break... Give me a break. Give me a break. You know what let's see what happens in court. This is a civil case. Very easy to have settled. Could settle it now. Very easy to have settled. Let's see what happens at the end of a couple years when this case is over OK? Yes it has been going for a long time. We'll win the case. One one of the victims. I gave many people their money back. Let me just... We will see who's right at the end of a few years. But all of the almost all of the people many many people signed what's called the report card at the end did you like the course how did you like it. Almost all of them said it was terrific OK? With letters with this. Some of them are on tape saying it was terrific. Let's see what happens at the end of three years. I gave some refunds to people because if they asked for the refunds in a certain period of time and we gave refunds to people. But let's see what happens at the end of three years. Let's see who's right. It's called pending litigation. Let me tell you the real con artist. Excuse me. Excuse me. The real con artist is Senator Marco Rubio who was elected in Florida and who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate. He doesn't go to vote. He's absent. He doesn't go. Now the people of Florida can't stand him. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher. The people of Florida the people of Florida and by the way I know he's going to spend $25 million on ads. Without that he wouldn't have a chance. He's 20 points south.The people in Florida wouldn't elect him dogcatcher. He couldn't get any he's right now 21 points down to me. And you know... ... again there will be a lot of advertising. It's the only thing that might save him. But I doubt it. He scammed the people of Florida. He scammed people. He doesn't vote. He doesn't show up for the U.S. Senate. He doesn't vote. He scammed the people. He defrauded the people of Florida. You defrauded the people of Florida little Marco. That was licensing. Oh stop it. It's just a minor case. It's a minor case. It's a minor civil case. Give me a break. It's a minor civil case. There are many many civil cases. Give me a break. I don't believe these politicians. All talk no action. I'm standing here listening to I'm hearing him say about a percentage. CNN he gets 15. That means 85 percent based on what you're saying of the people don't dig you number one number one. Is that a correct statement? How do you get are you at 15 in the new CNN poll? Do you believe in CNN? I mean I know we're with FOX. But CNN spent CNN... CNN spent a lot of money on a poll just came out. I'm at 49. He's at 15. He tells me about 65 percent of the people. It's not 65 percent of the people. If you go by that 85 percent of the people. Then he goes we have five. And well excuse me I won 10. I won 10 states. If you listen to him it's like I won 10 states. Everybody knows that on Super Tuesday Trump was the winner. There wasn't one person that didn't say that. Even the two people on your left and right said we did a great job. So how does he take how does he take five and say it's better than 10? I am by far the leader. But if you listen to a politician he'll try and convince you otherwise. No I don't. No I don't. According to your poll... ... I know but your recent polls have me beating Hillary Clinton and very very easily. I have nothing to say. I mean generally speaking agree with what he said. I would have certainly have rather left it to the states. I was always in favor I was very surprised when they came up with that decision. I would have certainly I would have preferred had it been left to the states and I think most people would have preferred that. No I'm a big defender of the Second Amendment. And if you look at what's happened whether it's in California where you had the 14 people killed whether it's in Paris which by the way has the toughest gun laws in the world and 130 people killed. Many many people in the hospital gravely injured. They will be dying. Many people will be dying in addition. If we had guns or if they had guns on the other side of the room with the bullets going in the opposite direction you would not have had 130 people killed. That I can tell you right now. So I'm a very very big supporter of the Second Amendment. I don't support it anymore. I do not support the ban on assault. I I did not say that. I did not say that. I did not say that. So we're listening to the all-talk no-action politician and he was the primary supporter of John Roberts who gave us Obamacare. No it's not. You take a look. He was the primary supporter. He pushed John Roberts and pushed him and pushed him and Bush ultimately appointed him. He got appointed. And when it came his time to raise his hand and kill Obamacare not once but twice he let us down and he did the wrong thing. This is the man that was the primary supporter. And you can read law journal you can read whatever you want to read I've read plenty of it. There was no stronger supporter of John Roberts than him. And it was a very very big mistake. Not what you say in the op-ed. That is not what you said in the op-ed. Yeah I know it is. But it's not what you said in the op-ed. Lyin' Ted. Well let me just say this. I've gotten to know Marco over a period of time believe me he is not a leader. Believe me. He didn't answer he's not a leader. And frankly when I say they'll do as I tell them they'll do as I tell them. And that's very it's very simple. It's very simple. We are in a very dangerous place. We have a depleted military. Totally depleted. We have by the way our vets are treated horribly. We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to start taking care of our vets properly like we should. But we're going to build up our military and we're going to get the equipment we want not the equipment that's sold to us by somebody that gave him and him and not the governor campaign contributions. OK? We're going to get the equipment that the generals and the soldiers want.I will prove to be a great leader. And you know it's very interesting we talk about the polls. Every single poll when it comes to ISIS and the military and the border say by far Trump is the best. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. He said very good things about me and I said... Yeah finish. Let me just tell you first of all I've been hearing this man so long talking about Putin. Putin said about me I didn't say about Putin Putin said very nice things about me. And I say very nicely wouldn't it be nice if actually we could get along with Russia we could get along with foreign countries instead of spending trillions and trillions of dollars? You're talking about Flint Michigan. You're talking about places we need to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. Wouldn't it be nice if we got along with the world and maybe Russia could help us in our quest to get rid of ISIS et cetera et cetera? I think I'd get along very well with Vladimir Putin. I just think so. Even if it's not me? Let me just start off by saying... ... OK that I'm very very proud of millions and millions of people have come to the Republican Party over the last little while. They've come to the Republican Party. And by the way the Democrats are losing people. This is a trend that's taking place. It's the biggest thing happening in politics and I'm very proud to be a part of it. And I'm going to give them some credit too even though they don't deserve it. But the answer is: Yes I will. Yes I will. Yes. I will. Thank you. I am going to bring jobs back to the United States like nobody else can. We're going to fix our very depleted military. We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to strengthen our borders. And you're going to be very very proud of this country in just a few years if I'm elected president. Thank you."
2016-03-03 00:00:00,wallace," Tonight there are just four candidates on this stage. Their position has been determined by their standing in an average of the five most recent national polls as recognized by FOX News and conducted and released by March 1st. Here they are. Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Florida Senator Marco Rubio. And Ohio Governor John Kasich. Mr. Trump as you may have heard the 2012 Republican nominee for President Mitt Romney had some things to say about you today. He said your domestic policy will lead to recession he's said your foreign policy will make us less safe and then he listed what he said are your personal qualities. Quoting now Romney on Trump quote ""the bullying the greed the showing off the misogyny the absurd third-grade theatrics"". He challenged you to answer with substance not insults. How do you answer Mitt Romney sir? Mr. Trump Romney also talked about your position on race and the controversy over your failure to denounce David Duke on Sunday. You have repeatedly disavowed him since then but I'd like to go deeper than that. What are your views on the Klu Klux Klan and white supremacists? Thank you sir. Well then we want to focus now on the economy which is one of the top issues on Facebook with 6.6 million people discussing it online. A lot of that conversation is happening here in Detroit where the unemployment rate is 10.9 percent. That's more than double the national average. Senator Rubio you have taken to calling Mr. Trump a con artist who portrays himself as a hero to working people while he's really been in your words ""sticking it"" to the American workers for 40 years. But he has built a big company that employs thousands of people. Question. How many jobs have you created? Mr. Trump it's not your turn. You'll get your turn sir. Sir? Mr. Trump I'd like you to respond. You have 30 seconds to respond. But as part of that could you respond to his specific assertion about Trump Collection clothes which you say some of it is made in Mexico? Mr. Rubio Senator Rubio why don't you let him finish? But wait one second. Specifically and quickly on the question will you promise that you will and how soon will you move your clothing collection the clothes that are made in China and Mexico? Thank you. Thank you Mr. Trump. Senator Rubio? Wait wait Senator Rubio. I have a policy question for you sir. Gentlemen. Gentlemen. You have got to do better than this. Mr. Trump I would like to ask you a policy question. Your proposed tax cut... Mr. Trump your proposed tax cut would add $10 trillion to the nation's debt over 10 years even if the economy grows the way that you say it will. You insist that you could make up for a good deal of that you say by cutting waste fraud and abuse. Like what? And please be specific. But Mr. Trump Mr. Trump your numbers don't add up. Please put up full screen number four. The Education Department you talk about cutting the total budget for the education department is $78 billion. And that includes Pell grants for low-income students and aid to states for special education. I assume you wouldn't cut those things. The entire budget for the EPA the Environmental Protection Agency $8 billion. The deficit this year is $544 billion. That's more than a half trillion dollars. Your numbers don't add up sir. Mr. Trump... No you are not. No you're not sir. Let's put up full screen number 2. You say that Medicare could save $300 billion a year negotiating lower drug prices. But Medicare total only spends $78 billion a year on drugs. Sir that's the facts. You are talking about saving more money on Medicare prescription drugs... But that doesn't really cut the federal deficit. That's the only money that we buy the only drugs that we pay for is through Medicare. No. I promise I will get to you in a moment sir. Senator Cruz one of centerpieces of your campaign in fact you mentioned it again tonight is that you will abolish the IRS. Question though who will collect the taxes that you are still calling for? Who will oversee to make sure that people pay the taxes that they rightfully owe? And who will check on the various tax deductions and tax credits that you still want? Governor Kasich I promise I will get to you. But you do get 30 seconds to respond Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump... Governor Kasich Democrats as you know will make income inequality a big issue in the general election. You support raising the minimum wage although you say not to the $15 an hour that Democrats are talking about. Mr. Trump opposes any increase because he says it will price American workers out of the world market. Is he wrong about that? No increase in the minimum wage? But you did talk about states doing it. Thank you Governor. Much more to come live from the Fox Theater including where the candidates stand on the social issues facing the country. The Republican presidential debate continues in a moment. For for half a century as you all know Detroit was the symbol of America's industrial might: 300000 manufacturing jobs in this city. At last count there are now fewer than 30000 manufacturing jobs here and the unemployment rate in this city is 11 percent twice the national average. Senator Cruz I know that you have general plans for tax reform but what specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and train residents of cities like Detroit to do those jobs? Well I was going to say I'll give you 30 seconds to try to answer my question. What specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to Detroit and to train the residents here to do those jobs? Thank you Senator. And coming up the candidates tackle foreign policy. But first during the commercial break join us for a Facebook live on the Fox News Facebook page and tell us what you think about tonight's debate in the comments section. Stay with us. More to come. And gentlemen we're going to focus for a bit now on foreign policy. Senator Rubio you like to take a shot at Mr. Trump on the campaign trail saying that negotiating a hotel deal in a foreign country is not foreign policy. The other day you even compared him to Kim Jong-un the North Korean leader as lunatics trying to get a hold of nuclear weapons.Please tell Mr. Trump why he's unprepared to be commander-in- chief. Mr. Trump your response. He didn't interrupt you. Let him talk. Mr. Trump your time is up. Gentlemen you both have had a chance to talk. You both have had a chance to talk a couple of times. I'd like to move on to Senator Cruz. Senator we have some breaking news tonight. North Korea's dictator Kim Jong-un has ordered that country's nuclear weapons to be made ready at a moment's notice. And this comes just hours after the U.N. Security Council announced that approved the toughest sanctions in two decades against that country. Assume you're President Cruz tonight. What do you do? Thank you Senator. Governor Kasich I want to move back to the debate that we heard earlier about Vladimir Putin. In December after Vladimir Putin had some nice thing to say about Donald Trump calling him bright and talented your campaign ran a video suggesting that Trump might name the Russian president as his running mate. Here's a clip. That was your campaign video sir. Well OK. If I may sir if I may ask my question... I think you were kidding. But it was your video and the serious question is because the suggestion is do you think that Donald Trump is naive about the threat that Vladimir Putin represents? Governor... Governor thank you. Mr. Trump I'm going to ask you a version of the same question. As we saw today with Mitt Romney the #NeverTrump movement is gaining steam. Some people are talking about contributing millions of dollars to try to stop you. Again today you raised the possibility that you might run as an independent if you feel you're treated unfairly by the Republican Party. So I'm going to phrase the question that the other three people on this stage just got. Can you definitively say tonight that you will definitely support the Republican nominee for president even if it's not you? Thirty seconds sir. Yes you will support the nominee of the party? Senator Rubio 30 seconds closing statement. Not by a long shot. A special edition of ""The O'Reilly Factor"" is next. And remember Fox News has the race for the White House covered all the way to the conventions and onto the general election."
2016-03-03 00:00:00,moderators, Bret Baier (Fox News); Megyn Kelly (Fox News); and Chris Wallace (Fox News)
2016-03-03 00:00:00,kelly," Good evening and welcome to the fabulous FOX Theatre in downtown Detroit the site of the 11th Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. I'm Megyn Kelly along with my co-moderators Bret Baier and Chris Wallace. Tonight's rules are simple. Up to 60 seconds for each answer 30 seconds for each follow-up response and if a candidate goes over the allotted time you will hear this. Really. OK Senator Cruz you say that you are the true conservative in this race. But 15 states have voted now and you have won only four of them. You have lost repeatedly with what is supposed to be your core voter groups including evangelicals and conservatives. Hasn't your brand of conservatism been rejected by an electorate that appears to be more taken with Mr. Trump's populist message? Go ahead Mr. Trump. Go ahead Senator Rubio. ... OK... ... Alright... ... Go ahead Mr. Trump and then we're going to have to go to Governor Kasich. ... Hold on Senator hold on... ... Hold on hold on hold on... ... The audience cannot understand when you're talking over each other. Finish your point Mr. Trump. OK. All right. Let's talk immigration for a little bit. Senator Cruz let's start with you. You have repeatedly touted how you have stood shoulder to shoulder with Senator Jeff Sessions to fight illegal immigration and amnesty. But Senator Sessions just endorsed Donald Trump. If voters want Jeff Sessions-style immigration policies isn't their choice rather clear? OK. All right. Mr. Trump... Well stand by stand by Senator Cruz. Let's move on. And with all due respect we have we have questions. We have questions. No no no. Hold on. Hold on. We can do more of this later. Mr. Trump hi. How are you doing? Great to have you here. As are you. Back in January you gave an off-the-record interview to the New York Times. It was apparently audiotaped. Now a recent report in Buzzfeed citing sources at the Times reports that in that interview you expressed flexibility when it comes to your immigration policy specifically with respect to your promise to deport the 11 million people who are now living here illegally. You have suggested that you may have expressed some flexibility when it comes to the size of the wall that you want to build. But did you tell them specifically that you are flexible when it comes to your deportation plan? How flexible are you on this issue? Senator Rubio you not only supported the failed immigration reform effort through the Gang of Eight but you're still on record as favoring an eventual path to citizenship for those who are here illegally. And in addition... ...you favored in-state tuition for Florida illegal immigrants. You've been hitting Mr. Trump hard on this flexibility discussion with the New York Times but his supporters might say at least his opening stance was tough. Mr. Trump we will let respond but will you release the tapes? Will you authorize of The Times to release the tapes? Will you release the tapes? OK. Stand by. We're going to continue this right after the break. We have more. Welcome back everybody to the FOX News Republican presidential debate live from the FOX theater here in Detroit. Let's get back now to the questions. Mr. Trump your campaign website to this day argues that more visas for highly skilled workers would quote ""decimate American workers"". However at the CNBC debate you spoke enthusiastically in favor of these visas. So which is it? So you abandoning the position on your website... And you're not releasing the discussion with the New York Times behind closed doors... Which will have some asking whether on your immigration policies you're really just playing to people's fantasies which is a tactic... ... you praised in your book The Art of the Deal. Senator Cruz not long ago you propose quintupling the number of these foreign worker visas. After you announced for president you reversed yourself citing reports that the program was being abused. But that abuse had been around long before your 180. In fact it was so bad that just a few months earlier that a bipartisan group of senators called for an investigation and you declined to join them. Isn't it a good thing that the American public didn't trust Ted on that one? ... OK. ... Times up sir... ... Go ahead Mr. Trump. Understood. Thank you. Go ahead sir. All right. OK. All right. Let's leave it at that. Let's leave it at that. We have more to get to. We're going to have more questions for the candidates right after this break. And during the commercial break join us for a Facebook live on the FOX News Facebook page and tell us what you think about tonight's debate in the comment section. Mr. Trump one of the things people love about you is they believe you tell it like it is. But time and time again in this campaign you have actually told the voters one thing only to reverse yourself within weeks or even sometimes days. We've teed up just three examples in a videotape similar to those we used with Senator Rubio and Senator Cruz in the last debate. The first is on whether the war in Afghanistan was a mistake. Watch. Next on whether we should accept... Two more and then you'll have the floor. Next on whether we should accept the Syrian refugees... On whether we should accept the Syrian refugees. Most recently on whether President George W. Bush lied to get us into the Iraq war. I don't know if he lied or not. He could have lied. Maybe he did. Maybe he didn't. I guess you'd have to ask him. And there are many other examples. So how is any of this ""telling it like it is""? There are several examples Mr. Trump. We went through the Afghanistan being a mistake. Within one day you reversed yourself on Syrian refugees. But the point I'm going for is you change your tune on so many things and that has some people saying what is his core? Sean was the next day after Bill. Go ahead Governor. OK. Go ahead Senator. ... Go ahead Mr. Trump... Go ahead Senator. ... It's Senator Rubio's turn... ... Senator Rubio standby let him finish his point and then I'll give you the floor... ... With respect wait. With respect... ... With respect we went back and looked at this... The rating from the Better Business Bureau was a ""D"" minus... ... that's the last publicly available rating in 2010 and it was the result of a number of complaints they had... ... That's never been publicly available. ... Let's just bring the viewers up to speed let's just bring the viewers up to speed. Let me just set the record and then you guys can have at it. There was Trump University which was a business that you started and it was marketed... ... to many people and now there is a class-action of over 5000 plaintiffs against you Mr. Trump... ... And it involves veterans and it involves teachers and it involves so-called little guys working class and lower- working class and middle class who say that they were fleeced who say that it was as scam. The class has been certified and in that case you counter-sued the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed. That case was thrown out against her... ... But what happened was... OK no but standby. But what happened in that case was you counter-sued her. The court threw out your counter-suit and made you pay almost $800000 dollars in legal fees of hers and you made the same argument about 98 percent of the people being happy with Trump University. And that woman in particular signing a survey saying she liked it while someone was standing over her shoulder... ... And this is what standby this is what the Court of Appeals found. They said that the plaintiffs against you are like the Madoff victims... ...This is what the Court of Appeals said. This is what the court of appeals said. They found that victims of con artists often sing the praises of their victimizers until they realize they have been fleeced. It has been going for five years. Go ahead Senator. OK. Senator Rubio let him answer. Let him answer. Go ahead Mr. Trump. With respect Mr. Trump one-third of the plaintiffs in that case demanded refunds. So it's not the case that 98 percent were... OK. Still a pending litigation. All right. Senator Rubio then Senator Cruz. Go ahead. OK. I'm coming to you next. But go ahead. With respect you've made that point. Go ahead. All right. Stand by. I will come back to you. Senator Cruz wants to weigh in. You're coming back. Go ahead. Go ahead Mr. Trump. Go ahead Senator. Senator Cruz go. All right. I'm going to let Mr. Trump I'm going to let let me just... I'm going to let you respond to that Mr. Trump. I'm going to then go to you Governor. You're up next. OK. Do you want to weigh in? Governor thank you. Gentlemen thank you. Welcome back everybody to the Fox News Republican presidential debate. We want to get right back to the questions. Governor Kasich the city of Detroit has long suffered with urban blight broken street lights dilapidated and vacant houses and so on. In 2013 Detroit actually declared bankruptcy which helped but the schools here remain a big problem. They're $3.5 billion in debt and are some of the most troubled and poorly testing in the country. The kids too often go to classrooms that are unsafe falling apart infested with rodents and insects. Experts say the schools could go bankrupt by next month. Question to you. If the federal government bailed out the auto industry here in Detroit should it also bail out the Detroit schools? Welcome back everybody. We're going it get right back to the questions. Candidates it's now time for your closing statements. Governor Kasich we'll start with you. Mr. Trump your closing statement. Thank you sir. And that will do it for the 11th Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race. But the night is not over yet."
2016-03-03 00:00:00,rubio," Yes you know Bret let me say something. This campaign for the last year Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks. He has done so to people that are sitting on the stage today. He has done so about people that are disabled. He has done it about every candidate in this race. So if there is anyone who has ever deserved to be attacked that way it has been Donald Trump for the way he has treated people in the campaign.Now that said I would much prefer to have a policy debate. I hope that's what we will have here tonight. Let's have a policy debate... ... let's talk about Donald Trump's strategy and my strategy and Ted's strategy and John Kasich's strategy when it comes to ISIS. And on health care and on the important issues facing this country. But let's be honest too about all this. The media has given these personal attacks that Donald Trump has made an incredible amount of coverage. Let's start talking again about the issues that matter to this country. I'm ready to do that starting right here right now tonight. Yes I would just say a couple of things. There is no doubt that Donald has done well in these elections. There is no doubt about that. The numbers are there. Here is what the numbers also say. Two-thirds of the people who have cast a vote in a Republican primary or caucus have voted against you. They do not want you to be our nominee.And the reason why is because we are not going to turn over the conservative movement or the party of Lincoln or Reagan for example to someone whose positions are not conservative. To someone who last week defended Planned Parenthood for 30 seconds a debate stage. To someone for example that has no ideas on foreign someone who thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the 1980's. ... To someone who time and again on issue after issue has not proven that he has the principals... ... That outline what the conservative movement has been about. And as Ted said the things that made America great. America is great because of the conservative principles of limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense... ... And our nominee needs to be someone that stands by those things... ... Donald has not demonstrated that. ... ... ... ... ... Of all the people on this stage he performs the worst against Hillary Clinton. ... If you're our nominee we will lose... ... You lose by points. She will wipe you out. If you're our nominee ... ... Oh excuse me ... Well first of all government doesn't... First of all Chris my point is exactly right. He has spent a career of convincing Americans that he's something that he's not in exchange for their money. Now he's trying to do the same in exchange for their country. This is a fact. He talks about these great businesses that he's built. He inherited over $100 million. And with that money he lost more money than he made. He can start tonight by announcing that all the Donald Trump clothing will no longer be made in China and in Mexico but will be made here in the United States. And on the issue of job creation I find this interesting. The private sector creates jobs. The jobs of those of us in public service are to put in place policies that allow the economy to grow.That's the problem with the Democratic Party. They think government is what creates jobs. Government does not create jobs.Now the way you create jobs is you make America the easiest and the best place in the world to start a business or to expand an existing business. If you go on my website marcorubio.com you will see a real plan to fix our taxes to roll back regulations to repeal and replace Obamacare not just lines around the states. Serious policies and proposals. Here we go. Here we go. It's personal. The answer is he's not going to do it. And you know why? Because there are plenty of clothing makers in America. If you go on my website marcorubio.com everything we have on there is made in America. The reason why he makes it in China or Mexico is because he can make more money on it. That's why he's doing it. And the second point you see what happens again when you challenge him on a policy issue. You asked him about the economy and the first thing he does is launch an attack about some little guy thing. Because he doesn't have answers. And he's asking us to make him the president of the United States of America. This is not a game. Well then answer the economy question. But he doesn't answer the employment question. You ever heard of Trump Steaks? You ever heard of Trump Vodka? All of these companies he has ruined. Trump Steaks is gone. You have ruined these companies. Let's see if he answers it. All right well let's hear it big Donald. Well first of all let me say that on the issue of the off-the-record that's not up to the New York Times. That's up to you Donald. If tonight you tell the New York Times to release the audio they will do it and we can exactly see what your true views are on immigration... ... because it is a major issue in your campaign that you've made a center issue. Now as far as my record on it is concerned I absolutely want to solve this issue. And I did the best we could in a Senate that was controlled by liberal Democrats and Harry Reid in the hopes that the House made up of conservatives would take it up and make it even stronger. And I said that repeatedly at the time. I'm not just saying that now; I said it throughout that process. We do need to do with this issue. When I'm president it will not be dealt with the way it was done in the Senate.It will be done first and foremost by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving it to the American people. And only after that is done can anything else happen.And it will be something the American people support. We'll see what they are willing to support. It's not going to be an executive order and we're not going to ram it down their throats. That's not accurate. I'm sorry Megyn that's not accurate. That's my there were at least 300 Americans that applied last year none of them were hired. Some of them... ... have been interviewed... ... They were not hired... ... And here's why he does it this way let me explain why he H2-B... ... Because when you bring them in this way when you bring someone in on one of these visas they can't go work for anybody else. They either work for you or they have to go back home. You basically have them captive so you don't have to worry about competing for higher wages with another hotel down the street. And that's why you bring workers from abroad. You argue that you're here to fight on behalf of the American worker but when you have chances to help the American worker... ...but when you have chances to help the American workers you're making your clothes overseas and you're hiring your workers from overseas. There were Americans in that hot area. That's correct and Libya. Correct. Well Bret what I've argued from the very beginning is ISIS in order to defeat ISIS you must deny them operating spaces. This is how ISIS or any radical group for that matter can grow. It's how Al Qaida was able to carry out 9/11 is that the Taliban gave them an operating space in Afghanistan. Today that operating space has largely been based in Iraq and Syria but I've been warning about the Libyan presence for the better part of two years. So they need to be targeted wherever they have an operating space. They do need to be defeated on the ground by a ground force made up primarily of Sunni Arabs themselves. This is a radical Sunni movement. They can only be defeated if they are driven out and the territory is held by Sunni Arabs. But it will require a specific number of American special operators in combination with an increase in air strikes. And that will include if necessary operating spaces in Libya which in fact they are using to project into the Sinai against Egypt and ultimately into Europe as well. ... This isn't just about flexibility. There's a difference between flexibility and telling people whatever you think you need to say to get them to do what you want them to do. And that's what Donald has done throughout his career. Well he did and that's why Trump University... ... Is so relevant here. I saw this video last week where he's sitting in front of a camera saying we're going to hire the best people and I'm going to hand pick them. There are going to be hand picked and instructors the best instructors in the world. One of them but the way was the manager at a Buffalo Wild Wing. And that's who they hired to do this and people borrowed money and they signed up for this fake university. And these people owe all this money now and they got nothing in return for it but you are willing to say whatever you had to say... ...to get them to give you their money... ... And we're not going to do that to our country... ... That's false... ... That's false... ... The Better Business Bureau gave it a ""D"" minus. ... Go on my website Marco Rubio.com... ... this anymore. ... A third of the people ... I spoke to one of the victims yesterday. I spoke to one of the victims yesterday. No there are several. Obviously there are so many I can't talk to them every day. I spoke to one of them he told me exactly what happened. They signed up for this course because they believed Mr. Trump was this fantastic businessman that Donald is going to teach them the tricks of the trade. They signed up. They paid $15000 for this course. They were asked for additional money for this course. If they really wanted the real secrets of success they had to pay even more money and so they did.And you know what they got in these courses? Stuff you can pull off of Zillow. When they finally realized what a scam it was they asked for their money back.And you refused to give them their money back. Why don't you tonight... Then why don't you tonight say you're going to give the money back to everybody who wants... Megyn this is why this is relevant to this election. This is why because he's trying to do to the American voter what he did to the people that signed up for this course. He's making promises he has no intention of keeping. And it won't just be $36000 that they lose it's our country that's at stake here. The future of the United States and the most important election in a generation and he's trying to con people into giving them their vote just like he conned these people into giving him their money. Notice that's not an answer. There's no as you can see in his answer it's always the same thing. He has defrauding people out of things and not just and not just by the way on the issue of Trump University. He had another development in Mexico that he had nothing to do with except his name on the building. People put money into that building. They lost their money. Yes licensing but you told them you owned the building. So they gave him his money. They lost their money. Time and again... Well I know I've talked about it and others in our campaign have talked about it and other candidates have talked about it as well. What happened in Flint was a terrible thing. It was systemic breakdown at every level of government at both the federal and partially the both the state and partially at the federal level as well. And by the way the politicizing of it I think is unfair because I don't think that someone woke up one morning and said ""Let's figure out how to poison the water system to hurt someone."" But accountability is important. I will say I give the governor credit. He took responsibility for what happened. And he's talked about people being held accountable... ...and the need for change with Governor Snyder. But here's the point. This should not be a partisan issue. The way the Democrats have tried to turn this into a partisan issue that somehow Republicans woke up in the morning and decided ""Oh it's a good idea to poison some kids with lead."" It's absurd. It's outrageous. It isn't true. All of us are outraged by what happened. And we should work together to solve it. And there is a proper role for the government to play at the federal level in helping local communities to respond to a catastrophe of this kind not just to deal with the people that have been impacted by it but to ensure that something like this never happens again. As few as possible. The Second Amendment as I've said before is not a suggestion. It is the constitutional right of every American to protect themselves and their families. It is a right that it is the Second Amendment for a reason. It is right after the defense of the freedom of speech for a reason for clearly the founders of our nation understood and the framers of the Constitution understood that you cannot have life and you cannot have liberty and cannot pursue happiness if you are not safe. RUBIO: And the Second Amendment when people talk about gun laws what they need to realize is criminals don't follow gun laws. They're criminals. By definition they ignore the law. But the gun rights of Americans if you are talking to a law- abiding citizen and a gun-owner like myself if you pass a law I will follow whatever the law is. A criminal will not do it. They will continue to pursue these guns on the black market where they then go out and commit crimes and they steal guns from each other.Gun laws are not effective. They simply do not provide for safety. But they do however ensure that law-abiding people don't have access to weapons to protect themselves and guns to protect themselves but criminals always will be well armed. They don't care about the law; they don't follow the law. We will protect the Second Amendment when I'm president of the United States. When they're done with the yoga can I answer a question? Unbelievable. Well he's very flexible so you never know. Well first of all I think as we've seen throughout this campaign Donald has not shown a seriousness about the issues of foreign policy. He just simply hasn't. Whether it was the structure of our military even today he was asked a question about the issue of commanders not following his lead on killing the family of terrorists. And his answer basically was if I tell them to do it they're going to do it. Now that's just not true.Foreign policy is not only consequential I think much of our future now depends on it. You know I see a lot of young people at my events around the country. I feel great when they come.And I always them that despite the hardships of the moment I honestly believe that today's Millennials have a chance to be the greatest generation we've had in 100 years. I really do.Because the world today has hundreds of millions of people that can afford to be their clients their customers their partners people they collaborate with. But that won't happen if the world is dangerous and it's unstable.And that will require strong American leadership. The next president of the United States is going to have eight years of a mess of a foreign policy to clean up. That's why it can't be Hillary Clinton.And quite frankly that's why it can't be someone who simply has not shown the intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning about these very complicated issues. And Donald simply hasn't. But that doesn't answer the question. Yeah I just want to a couple points. Once again he was pressed on a policy issue to show his understanding of the foreign policy and his reaction was just to attack somebody else with a name. Here's the bottom line. And I'm going to repeat it again. The world today is as complicated and as complex as it has been certainly in a very certainly in the lifetime of anybody here today. You indeed do have a lunatic in North Korea with nuclear weapons. You indeed do have the Chinese government taking over the most important shipping lane in the world. And Vladimir Putin who you've expressed admiration for Donald... You've expressed admiration for him. Donald you said he's a strong leader. He is now dividing Europe up... All right I'm going to finish my statement here. And he's also sowing instability in the Middle East. You have Iran who's going to get $100 billion of sanctions relief. You have radical jihadists spreading all over the world. This is a time for seriousness on these issues. You have yet to answer a single serious question about any of this. Will you give us a detailed answer about foreign policy any time you're asked on it? I'll support the Republican nominee. I'll support Donald if he's the Republican nominee and let me tell you why. Because the Democrats have two people left in the race. One of them is a socialist. America doesn't want to be a socialist country. If you want to be a socialist country then move to a socialist country. The other one is under FBI investigation. And not only is she under FBI investigation she lied to the families of the victims of Benghazi and anyone who lies to the families of victims who lost their lives in the service of our country can never be the commander- in-chief of the United States. We must defeat Hillary Clinton. Well I know this has been an unusual election cycle as it continues and there's a lot of problems in America and people are truly hurting. But this election is not just about confronting our problems; it's also about embracing our opportunities. I believe the 21st century holds the potential to be the greatest era in the history of the United States if we get this election right and if we act now. If we do if we do what needs to be done we can leave our children as the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived and the 21st century can be the greatest era in the amazing story of America. So I ask everyone to vote for me and join our effort at marcorubio.com."
2016-03-03 00:00:00,kasich," You know this so much about process. It frankly is boring to me. I would like it clear though since we're talking about polls I beat Hillary Clinton by more than 11 points and the reason it happens... ... The reason it happens... ... You know the reason is because as the Democrats tell me all the time I can get the crossover votes. You see because throughout this campaign I've talked about issues I have never tried to go and get into these scrums that we're seeing here on the stage. And people say everywhere I go ""you seem to be the adult on the stage."" In terms of you know Mitt Romney's a great guy but he doesn't determine my strategy. The fact of the matter is I'm running for president because I worked hard to fix this country when I was in Washington as the Chairman of the Budget Committee where we had some of the most significant job growth after we balanced the budget.We had wages going up it was very successful in Ohio. Our wages grow faster than the national average. We're up over 400000 jobs. We paid down back in the old days they paid down half a trillion dollars of the national debt. It's a formula that works. And I believe that formula will work when I return to Washington as the president.And by the way I won't need on the job training because I know how to do all of this and within the first 100 days I will have a plan that will pass the Congress because... ... It is reasonable and I can bring both sides together... ... Well Bret I think we're all really there. I mean the simple fact is that you know you all wrote me off. You wrote me off before I even got to New Hampshire then when I finished in New Hampshire you wrote me off in the South then you wrote me off in Super Tuesday. I split delegates in Vermont with Donald Trump I finished second in Massachusetts and we won delegates in Virginia. But guess what? It's now March Madness and we're heading up North to the place to my turf OK? And let me just tell you this I will win Ohio and I am going to move all across this country and over time as people begin to finally hear my message you know what people say Bret to me all the time?Why don't they give you any time on the debate stage? Why is that? So now all of a sudden I'm starting to get it and what I want the people to know is I know how to bring people together Republicans and Democrats. I have successfully both at the federal level and the state level brought economic growth wage growth and economic security to this country.And I want to go back and do it again and I'm going to keep talking about my message of bringing people together and motivating people in the neighborhoods that realize they don't need somebody from Washington galloping in. There are many things they can do where they live because the strength of our country is in our neighborhoods and our families. And I'm going to keep doing this. Can I... Well well wait a minute first of all I didn't say I was for an increase in the federal minimum wage. I said in Ohio we increased it modestly every single year. So I'm not for a federal minimum wage increase. Well states if states want to do it they ought to sit down with businesspeople and the lawmakers and figure out what will work. But hold on a second here with everything else. I'm the only person on this stage who actually was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget. It's not a theory for me. It's not it's not some you have to know how to put everything together. And you know I spent 10 years of my life to get there and I did not do that because I'm worshiping at some balanced budget shrine.The reason I did it is when you have commonsense regulations lower taxes on individuals and businesses and you have a fiscal plan that makes sense the job creators will expand employment. And what happened? When I was there the jobs were exploding. Bill Clinton's tried to take credit for it. When I went to Ohio we're up 400000 jobs. It's the same formula.But it isn't easy. I fought the entire Washington establishment and won because when you balance a budget you must affect every single thing. Everything in the federal government specifically. You cannot get there with theories or broad statements and you have to be willing to take the heat. In fact I fought a Republican president who I thought was not offering constructive proposals to fix this economy.So when we talk about all this there's one person on this stage and one person who's been a candidate for president in either party that restored economic strength growth a balanced budget paid down debt cut taxes the things that people in this country want. No theories. Reality. Well first of all just to be clear not only did I serve for 18 years on the Defense Committee more than anybody on this stage but secondly I was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 to help Secretary Rumsfeld with some of his difficulties. I will say look let me tell you what happened with Libya. And I pointed out in the last debate Hillary Clinton worked aggressively to depose Moammar Gadhafi. We had no business doing it. He was working with us. He was cooperating with us. He denuclearized. And now they pushed him out and now we have a fertile ground for ISIS.Fortunately in Libya there's only a few cities on the coast because most of Libya is a desert. The fact of the matter is we absolutely have to be and not just with special forces. I mean that's not going to work. Come on. You've got to go back to the invasion when we pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. We have to be there on the ground in significant numbers. We do have to include our Muslim Arab friends to work with us on that. And we have to be in the air.And we it should be a broad coalition made up of the kinds of people that were involved when we defeated Saddam. Now you've got to be on the ground and in the air both in Syria and Iraq. And at some point we will have to deal with Libya. I am very concerned about ISIS getting their hands on the oilfields in Libya and being able to fund their operations. The fact is cool calm deliberate effective take care of the job and then come home. That's what we need to do with our military foreign policy. Bret it's very interesting to note I think it's for the good of the record here that they took a survey of foreign policy magazines 700 foreign policy experts who would be the best person to conduct foreign policy of all the candidates in the race? I received 55 percent of the vote. Jeb Bush received 30 percent of the vote. And everybody else none of them made double digits. And that's because you have to have the experience.And you know we hear about Ronald Reagan rebuilding the military. I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the military. I worked with him. I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the economy. I was there and I worked with him. I knew Ronald Reagan.And I'll leave it right there with what comes after that. You can figure that one out. Megyn. I did 200 meetings in New Hampshire I don't know how many in Michigan now. In these townhalls people come in and they're very emotional meetings. And you know what they really want to know? If somebody tells them something can they believe it? And the reason why people are so upset in this country is because politicians all the time tell them what they want to hear. And they go to Washington or they go to the state capital wherever and they don't deliver on those promises.You know when I ran for Governor of Ohio I said not only would we balance the budget but we would cut taxes. People said that can't be done. I wouldn't have said it if I didn't believe it.We cut taxes in Ohio more than any governor in the country and $5 billion dollars worth of tax cuts we're not running a surplus in Ohio. But you see what's getting in the hearts and souls of the people is they want change and they keep putting outsiders in to bring about the change then the change doesn't come. Then they put more outsiders in because we're putting people in that don't understand compromise. They don't understand policy... ...They're getting more and more frustrated with the system which is why we must pick somebody that has a record of achievement not just talk. Not just talk but a record of achievement. That's how we'll restore credibility.. All right look honestly when I see people at these meetings these town halls where we take massive questions and I get to spend time with them. Last night there was a woman that came to tell me about the loss of her 15-year-old son who took his own life. See there's people in this country and Ted's right their wages haven't gone up for so long they see the rich get richer they believe and they're not moving. And they put their money in the bank and they got no interest on their money. They receive none. And their sons or daughters are living in the basement because they can't get a good job after they rang up so much college debt.What people are hungry for is who can fix this? People want to know who what can you do to solve the problems in Washington to make sure that we have stronger job growth and better wages? But you know what else they're yearning for? They want to believe that they have the power to fix things where they live and they want the power back so they can begin to do things in their community.Now listen this has been going on for a long time here. And I appreciate the discussion back and forth. But there are a lot of people out there yearning for somebody who's going to bring America back both at the leadership level and in the neighborhood where we can begin to reignite the spirit of the United States of America. And let's stop fighting. Well look first of all I think the mayor now is controlling the schools. This is not much different than what happened in Cleveland Ohio where the African-American Democrat mayor the union and business leaders came to see me and said ""Would you help us to pass legislation to really create a CEO environment so that we can take control of the schools?"" We even invested in a buyout plan where we bought out the teachers who had been there a long time because there were so many young teachers who had been laid off who were so enthusiastic to get back in the schools. It worked beautifully. Cleveland's coming back. The Cleveland schools are coming back because of a major overhaul.It's the same thing that has to happen in all of our urban schools. And frankly look if I were president I'd take 104 federal programs bundle them into four buckets and send it to the states because fixing schools rests at the state and the local level and particularly at the school board level. Now I also believe I also believe that you need to introduce vocational education in those schools. You need mentoring in those schools. And you need to have a situation where people can have an alternative forum to get a degree. And you need school choice both vouchers and charter schools. All of those things can come together to help Megyn.But here's the bottom line. And I'll go quickly. We as adults have to fight in our neighborhoods in our communities for our children's education. Put the politics aside and everyone in this room can play a role in lifting their schools and lifting the students who are in those schools because too much politics gets in the middle of it and where we focus as adults and put children first we see tremendous results. And the people of this town are going to rise. And they need to be involved. Thank you. Well look first of all I try to be a man of faith every day as best as I can and I try to focus in my faith on the dos and I think the don'ts will take care of themselves once I get the dos right which is humility and loving my enemy and caring for my neighbor. But secondly look you're in the commerce business you want to sell somebody a cupcake great. OK? But now if they ask you to participate in something you really don't like that's a whole 'nother issue OK? Another issue.Here's what I'd like to see happen. The Supreme Court ruled I don't agree with the ruling. I'm of favor of marriage between you know traditional marriage a man and a woman. What I hope was going to happen after the Supreme Court ruling is things would settle down.If you go to a photographer to take pictures at your wedding and he says I'd rather not do it find another photographer don't sue them in court. You know what the problem is in our country in our country we need to learn to respect each other and be a little bit more tolerant for one another.And at the end of the day don't go to court. Can't we have common sense in America? That's the way it used to be. And there was a book written called ""The Death of Common Sense."" We need to bring it back.But at the end of the day if somebody is being pressured to participate in something that is against their deeply-held religious beliefs then we're going to have to think about dealing with the law.But you know what I'd rather people figure this out without having to put another law on the books and have more arguments in this country. Why don't we come together as a country respect one another love one another and lift this country? I think that's what people want.So thanks for asking. I'll have to see this. That was a pretty good one. No I... Of course. I'm not biting. Let me take you around the world OK? Let me look I'm going to take you very quickly. In Russia we need to tell them we're going to arm the Ukrainians with defensive lethal weapons. And we're going to tell Putin if you attack anybody in Eastern Europe in NATO you attack Finland and Sweden which is not in NATO consider it an attack on us. And he will understand that.Secondly I would tell the Chinese you don't own the South China Sea. Stop hacking us. And we're going to beef up our cyber command. And we're going to be in a position to be able to take out your systems if you continue to do this.Now let's move over into the Middle East. The Egyptians they know they're on their last legs there because of the attack from ISIS. The Jordanians are really have been our friends. They know that they are at risk. So do the Saudis. So do the Gulf states.They are our allies really or have similar aims we need to bring them closer to us. Turkey a critical avenue to the Middle East. We have to bring them towards the West and not towards the East. And we have a joint good human intelligence. That is called a semi-trip around the world. And if you gave me more time I'd finish the trip. Thank you. Yeah. But and I kind of think that before it's all said and done I'll be the nominee. But let me also say... But let me also say remember... But I'm the little engine that can. And yeah look when you're in the arena and we're in the arena. And the people out here watching we're in the arena we're traveling we're working we spend time away from our family when you're in the arena you enter a special circle. And you want to respect the people that you're in the arena with. So if he ends up as the nominee sometimes he makes it a little bit hard but you know I will support whoever is the Republican nominee for president. Well ladies and gentlemen I love being here in Michigan and I want to say to all of you here that I have a record of being able to solve some of the biggest problems. It's not just talk and it's not theory. I did it in Washington by helping people get into a healthier economic situation. I've done it in Ohio. And as we've made progress in Ohio we've left no one behind. We've not left behind the mentally ill the drug addicted the working poor the developmental disabled and we have raised our minority community.And as president of the United States I will go back to Washington I will take the formulas that I used and I will I will fix the problems in Washington and you'll work with me as I send you power to fix your your communities your neighborhoods your state and together we'll restore the spirit of America. And I know you want that. Thank you."
2016-03-03 00:00:00,cruz," Well Megyn you know at the end of the day for the folks at home this is not about the insults back and forth between the candidates. This is not about what attacks we can throw at each other. This is the people at home who are struggling through seven years of Barack Obama. This is the single moms who are working two and three jobs 28 29 hours a week because their hours have been forcibly reduced because of Obamacare. This is the truck drivers and the steel workers and the mechanics with calluses on their hands who have seen their wages not grow year after year after year while the cost of living goes up.This is all the young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs that aren't able to find a job.And I don't think the people of America are interested in a bunch of bickering school children. They are interested in solutions not slogans. It's easy to say make things better make things great. You can even print it and put it on a baseball cap.But the question is do you understand the principles that made America great in the first place? As president I will repeal every word of Obamacare. I will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses.And we will pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS. And what that's going to do Megyn is small businesses are going to explode. We are going to see millions of high-paying jobs. We are going to see wages going up. We are going to see opportunity.That's where our focus needs to be. That's where my focus is. And that is why our campaign is the only campaign that over and over again has beaten Donald Trump to date and it's why we are the one campaign that going forward can and will beat Donald Trump in this election. So my simple flat tax I have rolled out in precise detail how it will operate where every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard. And if you want to actually see the postcard see all the details you can find them on our Web site. It's tedcruz.org. When he we get rid of all the corporate welfare all the subsidies all the carve-outs in the IRS code it dramatically simplifies it. And under Obama the IRS has become so corrupt and so politicized we need to abolish it all together.Now at the end of that there will still be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards but it will be dramatically simpler. And let me take a moment Chris to go back to go back to this exchange that was going on.In between all of the insults let me point out the specificity that was lacking. It's very easy to say ""Let's cut waste fraud and abuse."" I've rolled out a detailed plan to cut $500 billion in federal spending specifying exactly what I would cut. It's easy to say it but one of the great disconnects to all the people all of the voters I understand the folks who are supporting Donald right now. You're angry. You're angry at Washington and he uses angry rhetoric.But for 40 years Donald has been part of the corruption in Washington that you're angry about. And you're not going to stop the corruption in Washington by supporting someone who has supported liberal Democrats for four decades from Jimmy Carter to John Kerry to Hillary Clinton. You're not going to stop the corruption and the cronyism by supporting someone who has used government power for private gain. Instead we need a president who stands with the American people. Yes their choice is very clear. If you look to the actual record you know Donald mentioned a moment ago that he was just doing business when he was writing checks to liberal Democrats. But that's not in fact the checks he was writing. Listen we could all understand if you write a check to a city commission because you're looking for a zoning waiver on building a building. That may be corrupt but you could understand real estate developers doing that. CRUZ: That's not what Donald Trump did. Donald Trump supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan. Donald supported John Kerry over George W. Bush. If you don't like Obamacare Donald Trump funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.On immigration if you don't like amnesty if you don't like the Gang of Eight Donald Trump funded five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight $50000.And let's talk about this election. The choice Republican primary voters are making is who is best prepared to stand up to Hillary Clinton and beat Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once not twice not three times. Ten times. And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. It wasn't that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business. It was to her presidential campaign.Donald Trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton as president. So I'd like to ask Donald why did you write checks to Hillary Clinton to be president in 2008? It wasn't for business. And how can you stand on a debate stage now with her and say you don't think she should be president? But what would you say... ... to Hillary Clinton on the debate stage when you wrote her a check in 2008 wrote her four checks to be president? Well the abuse of the H1-B program has been rampant. On the face of that H1-B abuse I have proposed and promised as president that I will impose a 180 day moratorium on the H1B program to implement a comprehensive investigation and audit because you got U.S. companies that are firing American workers bringing in foreign workers and forcing them to train their replacements. And I would note that is not dissimilar to what we discovered at the last debate concerning the hotel that Donald owns down in Florida. Down in Florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers and afterwards it was really striking.I watched the CNN interview Donald did where he explained he said well the problem is you can't find Americans who are qualified or who want to work as waiters and waitresses. Now let me ask the people here how many people have worked as a waiter or waitress? Millions across this country. That is an astonishing statement. You know Marco's Dad started as a bartender. My Dad started washing dishes and yet you know how many Americans wanted those jobs? Roughly 300 applied Donald hired 17. And that's why this New York Times tape is so troubling because what's been reported is that Donald told the Editorial Board of the New York Times what I'm saying on immigration I don't believe. I'm not going to build a wall I'm not going to deport people this is all just rhetoric for the voters.Now if he didn't say that he has an easy solution. Simply release the tape.But for everyone at home who's mad at politicians that lied to us Donald's record right now as he standing here... ... His record right now is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens... ... abusing American workers... Donald you could resolve this issue very quickly by simply... ...releasing the New York Times tape. Because listen maybe it's right. ... that you didn't tell them you're misleading the American people. If that's the case... If you didn't tell them that the tapes will prove you're innocent. But if in fact you went to Manhattan and said I'm lying to the American people then the voters have a right to know. Because we've been lied to too many times. Why don't you release the tapes? Release the tapes. Bret you know I think the American people understand that yelling and cursing at people doesn't make you a tough guy. We need a commander-in-chief that number one will rebuild the military just like Ronald Reagan did in 1981 coming out of the weak Jimmy Carter administration. He passed tax reform and regulatory reform. The economy took off. It generated millions in high-paying jobs trillions in new revenue. He rebuilt the military bankrupted the Soviet Union and won the Cold War. As president I will do the exact same thing with radical Islamic terrorism. We will rebuild this military so that it remains the mightiest fighting force on the face of the planet. And then when I am commander-in-chief every militant on the face of the Earth will understand that if they go and join ISIS if they wage jihad against the United States of America they are signing their death warrant. Well Bret as someone who spent much of his life in law enforcement I believe you should start with the facts and evidence first before ending up with the verdict. When the news first broke of the United States government engaging in massive surveillance on American citizens that was a very troubling development and it's why the United States Congress acted to correct it. Now at the same time I said in that initial statement that if the evidence indicated that Edward Snowden violated the law he should be prosecuted for violating the law. And indeed since then the evidence is clear that not only does Snowden violate the law but it appears he committed treason. Treason is defined under the Constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of America and what Snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection.And Snowden's comments afterwards and his behavior afterwards he fled to Russia he fled to China. His conducts afterwards indicates that he was not a whistleblower but instead he was undermining the ability to defend this country. But we need a president who isn't rash who doesn't just pop off at the at the hip but waits to see what the facts are and then acts to defend this country. Megyn let me ask the voters at home is this the debate you want playing out in the general election? The stakes in this election are too high. For seven years millions of Americans we've been struggling wages have been stagnating people are hurting our constitutional rights are under assault. And if we nominate Donald we're going to spend the spring the fall and the summer with the Republican nominee facing a fraud trial... ... with Hillary Clinton saying... ... why did you give my campaign and my foundation $100000? And with Hillary Clinton... ... pointing out that he supported her four times in her presidential race. Donald learn not to interrupt. It's not complicated. Count to 10 Donald. Count to 10. Count to 10. The stakes are too high and if you are one of the 65 to 70 percent of Republicans who recognize that nominating Donald would be a disaster then I ask you to come join us. If you're supporting other candidates come join us. We welcome you to our team because we've demonstrated not once not twice not three times but five separate times we have beat Donald. And if you don't want him to be the nominee then I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution believe in freedom and want to turn this country around. All right I'll respond... All right well Donald lives by the polls every day. He tweets about the polls. He's told us to look to the CNN poll. Well that's a very good poll to look to because that CNN poll showed that head to head Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton by 8 points. He doesn't just lose close; he loses by 8 points. That same poll he told you to look at shows me beating Hillary Clinton. We cannot mess this up. And by the way the last four polls in a row when you nominate a candidate who literally has been on every side of every issue and in the course of this debate may be on two other sides before we're done that's not how you win. And the stakes are too high. Well Chris thank you for that question. Let me start by observing that Detroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of failed left-wing policy. You know Henry Ford revolutionized automobile manufacturing and brought automobiles to the middle class. During World War II Detroit provided funded the arsenals of democracy to help us win World War II. In in the 1960s Detroit was the Silicon Valley of America. It had a population of 2 million people had the highest per capita income in the country.And then for 50 years left-wing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies weak crime policies and have driven the citizens out. This city now has just 700000 citizens. There are vacant homes one after the other after the other. Crime has been rampant and it is an outrage. And let me say to folks in the media: That is a story that the media ought to be telling over and over again the destruction of left-wing policies and the millions who have hurt because of it. The way you bring manufacturing back to America is number one you lift the regulations. As president I will repeal Obamacare the biggest job-killer in America. I will pull back the federal regulators the EPA and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing.And my tax plan which is a very very detailed plan on the website tedcruz.org is what's called border adjustable. We get rid of all the taxes. We get rid of the corporate income tax and the death tax and the Obamacare taxes and the payroll tax. And we replace it with a 16 percent business flat tax that is border adjustable which means all exports are entirely tax-free and all imports pay the 16 percent business flat tax. That's a 32 percent differential.What that will do Chris is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country bring the steel industry back to this country create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field American ingenuity can beat anyone. But right now the federal government isn't giving us a level playing field. Well listen adoption is decided at the state level and I am a believer in the 10th Amendment in the Constitution I would leave the question of marriage to the states I would leave the question of adoption to the states. That's the way it has been for two centuries of our nation's history until five unelected judges in an illegitimate and wrong decision decided to seize the authority over marriage and wrongfully tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states.Now interconnected to this is the question of religious liberty. And at the last debate one of my colleagues on this stage said on the question of religious liberty and Supreme Court nominees that he'd be willing to compromise and negotiate.I can tell you for me there are areas that we should compromise on. Marginal tax rates we can reach a middle ground on. But when it comes to core principles and convictions when it comes to the Constitution and Bill of Rights I can tell the men and women at home I will never compromise away your religious liberty.And for me Bret religious liberty has been a lifelong passion. I've spent two decades defending religious liberty including defending the Ten Commandments before the U.S. Supreme Court and winning. Defending the Pledge of Allegiance before the Supreme Court and winning.And defending the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial a lone white Latin cross that was erected to honor the men and women who gave their lives in World War I. I represented 3 million veterans for free defending that memorial and we won 5-4 before the Supreme Court. Well listen unlike Donald I would not support banning firearms. In that instance Bill Clinton banned many of the most popular firearms in America. And by the way the study showed that ban did nothing to reduce violent crime. It just took away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. And let me point out you know it is easy for political candidates to have rhetoric and say ""I support the Second Amendment."" But you cannot say that and at the same time say what Donald just said which is that on the question of Supreme Court nominees he wants to compromise and reach a middle ground with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer. That's what he said in the last debate. And any justice that Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer sign off on... And I would point out Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer are both Democrats that Mr. Trump has written checks to repeatedly. Any justice that those two sign off on is going to be a left-wing judicial activist who will undermine religious liberty and we are one vote away from the Heller decision being overturned which would effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights. If you care about the Second Amendment then you need to ask who on this stage do you know will appoint principled constitutionalists to the court and not cut a deal with your Second Amendment rights? That's flat-out wrong. You know Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth. I wrote one op-ed supporting President Bush's nomination after he made it. I would not have made that nomination. But let me point out... ... if Donald actually cared about... But Donald please I know it's hard not to interrupt. But try. Breathe breathe breathe. You can do it. You can breathe. I know it's hard. I know it's hard. But just... You cannot. I really hope that we don't we don't see yoga on this stage. But you cannot in fact care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Jimmy Carter for president. You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support John Kerry for president as Donald did. You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Harry Reid for Senate majority leader. And you cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and write four checks to Hillary Clinton for her to be president if you care at all about the Second Amendment or religious liberty or anything else. Yes. Yes. Well you're right the news is very disturbing that Kim Jong-un has put their nuclear weapons on ready state. I'm glad that we're sending another carrier group to the South China Sea. I'm glad that Congress passed sanctions on North Korea. But this is all the result of the failures of the Clinton administration two decades ago that negotiated a deal with North Korea lifting the sanctions allowing billions of dollars to flow in and they used that money to develop nuclear weapons in the first place.What we now we're in a much harder position. When you have a lunatic with nuclear weapons to some extent it constrains your options. We need to be moving the carrier carrier group to the South China Seas. We we need to be putting in place missile defense such as the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea.We need to be pursuing space-based missile defense. One of the advantages of space-based missile defense is that if you have a missile launch in North Korea or you have a missile launch in Iran a space-based missile defense can take out one or two or three missiles before it can cross over and do damage.And we also need to be putting pressure on China because North Korea is effectively a a client state of China. All of that will happen with a strong commander-in-chief that is devoted to keeping this country safe. Yes because I gave my word that I would. And what I have endeavored to do every day in the Senate is do what I said I would do. You know just on Tuesday we saw an overwhelming victory in the state of Texas where I won Texas by 17 percent. And I will say it was a powerful affirmation that the people who know me best the people who I campaigned who made promises that if you elect me I'll lead the fight against Obamacare I'll lead the fight against amnesty I'll lead the fight against our debt and I will fight for the Bill of Rights and your rights every day that the people of Texas said you have kept your word and that's what I'll do as president. I want to talk to every soldier and sailor and airman and Marine. I want to talk to every mom and dad and sister and brother and son and daughter of someone fighting for this country. For seven years you've had a commander-in-chief that doesn't believe in you that sends you into combat with rules of engagement that tie your arms behind your back. That is wrong. It is immoral. And in January 2017 it will end. I want to also talk to all the police officers and firefighters and first responders who have been left behind with this president. Starting in January 2017 I will have your back."

2016-02-11 00:00:00,woodruff," Good evening and thank you. We are happy to welcome you to Milwaukee for this Democratic debate. We are especially pleased to thank our partners at Facebook who have helped us set up a vibrant conversation among voters who are undecided. And tonight you're going to hear some of their questions for the candidates. And you can follow along at home on the PBS NewsHour page on Facebook. We also want to thank our hosts the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee on whose campus we meet here in the beautiful Helen Bader Concert Hall. Welcome Senator great to see you. And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Very good to be here with you. Now a word about format. There will be two short breaks and the rules are simple: 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond. Thank you both. Thank you both. And we'll be right back after a short break to begin questions. And welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate Democratic debate here in Milwaukee. Let's get right to the questions. Senator Sanders to you first. Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you and your ideas and they're asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government? It's already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy. How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency? But my question is how big would government be? Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government... Next we're going to... Very brief thank you. Secretary Clinton your campaign you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters. You have talked repeatedly about the fact we know you would be if elected the first woman president. But in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders. What are women missing about you? As you know just quickly as you know your strong supporter former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the other day that there's a special place in Hell for women who don't support other women. Do you agree with what she said? Senator Sanders you're in the minority but we still want to hear from you. Final comment. Secretary Clinton I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership and his example. Hardly anyone believes that they have. Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency? What would you do that the nation's first African American has not been able to? Senator Sanders? So race relation was be better under a Sanders presidency than they've been? Thank you. Senator Sanders one of the causes of anxiety for working class Americans is connected to immigrants. President Obama as you know has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the United States to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits. Would you go further than that? And if so how specifically would you do it? Should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight say in Nevada rest easy not fear of further deportations under a Sanders presidency? I'd like... We're going to move on. Secretary Clinton your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of Senator Sanders for attending Democratic Party fundraisers from which you say he benefited. But nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers George Soros and Donald Sussman for a total of about $10 million. You have said that there's no quid pro quo involved. Is that also true of the donations that wealthy Republicans give to Republican candidates contributors including the Koch Brothers? I'm asking if Democratic donors are different than Republican donors. We have to go to a break. We... All right. Thank you both. It is time for a break. And when we come back we're going to turn to some new topics including how these candidates will keep America safe. Welcome back to the Democratic presidential debate. Before we return to our questions we have a follow-up question from our Facebook group. And it is to Senator Sanders. Senator it comes from Bill Corfield. He is a 55-year-old musician from Troy Ohio. And he asks: ""Are there any areas of government you would like to reduce?"" Just a final word. Senator let me let me move on to another country with which the U.S. has a complicated relationship Senator Sanders and that's Russia. On the one hand we're aware that Russia is a country that the United States needs to cooperate with. Just tonight Secretary of State John Kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the Russians to lead that could lead toward a ceasefire in Syria would be the first cessation of conflict in that country in that civil war in five years but it comes at a very high price because not only have all have we seen the deaths the removal of so many people millions of people we now see the Russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits President Assad has not gone after ISIS. So my question to you is when it comes to dealing with Russia are you prepared how hard are you prepared to be? Are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions? Would you be prepared to move militarily if Russia moves on Eastern Europe? It seems to me that Russia recently has gotten the better of the United States. And we have a final question from our Facebook family. And it goes to Senator Sanders. It comes from Robert Andrews. He's a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad in Dover Massachusetts. He says ""The world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history. Can you name two leaders one American and one foreign who would influence your foreign policy decisions? And why do you see them as why are they influential?"" Secretary Clinton? And we want to thank our audience our quiet audience here in Helen Bader Concert Hall and to all of you watching at home. Thank you all. Stay tuned for analysis of the debate and the overall race for the Democratic nomination. That's coming up next here on PBS stations and online atPBS.org/NewsHour. And I'm going to be returning to Washington. I hope you'll join us for the PBS NewsHour tomorrow and every night. That's it from all of us here in Milwaukee. We thank you."

2016-02-11 00:00:00,ifill," We want to also extend our warm thanks to Milwaukee Public Radio and Milwaukee Public Television as well as all of our friends at the PBS member stations across the country tuning in tonight. This is the sixth time the Democrats have met face to face. Each time we learn more about them and the presidents they say they want to be. You know you're watching whether you're a Democrat a Republican or neither because you believe the outcome of the election is important to you. And we believe that too. With that let's welcome the candidates to the stage. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Welcome to you both. With Iowa and New Hampshire behind us we are now broadening the conversation to America's heartland and beyond including here in Wisconsin. Now let's turn to the candidates for their opening statements. The order was decided by coin toss. And Senator Sanders you go first. Thank you Senator Sanders. Thank you Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton. Final thought Senator. I'd like to move along. I'd like to move along. Secretary Clinton you might you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government. You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present in which these words were said: ""The era of big government is over."" You may remember that. When asked your feelings about the federal government this week 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied. Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing an expanding government in almost every area of our lives is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you? But I haven't heard either of you put a price tag on your you say... Senator? Senator do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history as Senator Clinton keeps claiming that she might be the first woman president? Thank you both. We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook. They were selected from a curated group of people we've been following of undecided voters. The first comes from Claudia Looze a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison Wisconsin. And she writes: ""Wisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration according to a University of Wisconsin study. They found that Wisconsin's incarceration rate for black men which is at 13 percent was nearly double the country's rate. What can we do across the nation to address this?"" Senator Sanders. Let me turn this on its head because when we talk about race in this country we always talk about African-Americans people of color. I want to talk about white people OK? I know. So many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country. By the middle of this century the nation is going to be majority nonwhite. Our public schools are already there. If working-class white Americans are about to be outnumbered are already underemployed in many cases and one study found they are dying sooner don't they have a reason to be resentful Senator Secretary Clinton? Senator Senator I want you to respond to that but I also want you to am I wrong? Is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race? If you would allow me now to move on we've been talking about children. I want to talk about seniors. That takes us to our second Facebook question from Farheen Hakeem who writes ""My father"" she's a 40-year-old woman who works for a nonprofit here in Milwaukee. And she writes ""My father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of Medicaid's family community program in Milwaukee County for low-income seniors. How will you as president work to ensure low-income seniors get their basic needs met?"" Start with you Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders are you saying... There's a lot more to come in just a few minutes. Stay with us for more of the PBS NewsHour Democratic Debate. How about you Senator Clinton Secretary Clinton? We spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity. The second part we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities. And we want to start with a question for you Secretary Clinton about America's role in the world. Americans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home that they already are in fact here. According to exit polls from last week from earlier this week more than two-thirds of Democrats in New Hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they can't win. They fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready. Are we? Senator Sanders... Secretary Clinton? Let me move on. You have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in Syria and in Libya. More than a million refugees entered Europe in 2015. Another 76000 just last month that is about 2000 arrivals every day. Nearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year crossing the Mediterranean. And there are reports that 10000 children are missing. If we are leaders in this world where should the U.S. be on this? What should the United States be doing Secretary Clinton? Senator if you would like respond to you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that. Thank you. Thank you Senator Clinton. Thank you Senator Sanders. We also want to thank our partners at Facebook and our hosts here at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. I'm going to remain here in Milwaukee tomorrow evening for a special edition of Washington Week here on PBS."
2016-02-11 00:00:00,clinton, Thank you. I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance especially those who have been left out and left behind. I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. And for good cause. Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years. There aren't enough good-paying jobs especially for young people. And yes the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top. We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again. But I want to go further. I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now. African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market education housing and the criminal justice system. Hardworking immigrant families living in fear who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future. Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay the equal pay that we deserve. I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential. That will be my mission as president. And I think together we will make progress. Judy I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40% but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans let's take healthcare for example. Last week in a CNN town hall the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5000 dollars in healthcare. Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up and that's a promise that cannot be kept and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because especially with healthcare this is not about math. This is about people's lives and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare. I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage. You know before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare. And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage. And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment namely the Affordable Care Act is because I know how hard it was to get that done. We are at 90 percent coverage. We have to get the remaining 10. I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down especially prescription drug costs. And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work. If it's Medicare for all then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act because the Affordable Care Act as you know very well is based on the insurance system based on exchanges based on a subsidy system. The Children's Health Insurance Program which I helped to create which covers 8 million kids is also a different kind of program. So if you're having Medicare for all single-payer you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal the numbers don't add up and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now. Well let me just let me just say once again... ...that having been in the trenches fighting for this I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. I believe we are on the path to doing that. The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again. And we are not England. We are not France. We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers. So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have get us to 90 percent coverage. We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again gridlocking our system and trying to get from zero to 100 percent. No. But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals to ask the really hard questions about what is it we think we can accomplish why do we believe that and what would be the results for the average American family? In my case whether it's health care or getting us to debt-free tuition or moving us toward paid family leave I have been very specific about where I would raise the money how much it would cost and how I would move this agenda forward. I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason Gwen that you are mentioning. There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. I'm aware of that. It comes from the right from the left from people on all sides of the political spectrum. So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep because that will further I think alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives. I will put a price tag. My price tag is about $100 billion a year. And again paid for. And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt. I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy by closing loopholes the things that we are way overdue for doing. And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that. But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear especially with young people about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost. You know I think again both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans. And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition. We differ however on a couple of key points. One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students it's hard to get to where we need to go. And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that. Well first Judy I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices even if that choice is not to vote for me. I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society. And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face. So I'm going to keep making that case. I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done everything that I stand for is going to be well known. But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. That's what I'm working towards. Well look I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her which is about 25 years. But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone women and men to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. That's what I've always stood for. And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay paid family leave some opportunity for you know women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them I think that we still have some barriers to knock down which is why that's at the core of my campaign. I would note just for a historic aside somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage. So you know we'll take our progress wherever we can find it. You know I have said I have said many times you know I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman. I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified experienced and ready person to be the president and the commander-in-chief. And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record. And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund because I've been a leader on these issues. I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves. I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues. Somebody who yes votes right but much more than that leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made that make no mistake about it are under tremendous attack not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights. So I'm asking women I'm asking men to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges. You know I completely agree with Senator Sanders. The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation twice the national average. And we know of the tragic terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee a young man unarmed who should still be with us. His family certainly believes that. And so do I. So we have work to do. There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. President Obama's policing commission came out with some. I have fully endorsed those. But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. And then we have to go after sentencing and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level it happens at the state and local level. But I would also add this. There are other racial discrepancies. Really systemic racism in this state as in others education in employment in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people particularly young men are pushed out of school early are denied employment opportunities. So when we talk about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration we also have to talk about jobs education housing and other ways of helping communities. Well I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance to be taken care of but we also know a lot more than we did. We have a lot more social media we have everybody with a cellphone. So we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. I think President Obama has set a great example. I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult but he has gone forward. Now what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next. We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. We now have some good models about how better to provide employment housing and education. I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president and to address it both from the President's office and through his advocacy such as working with young men and Mrs. Obama's work with young women. But we can't rest. We have work to do and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. So it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. Nobody can deny them. To use the Justice Department as we just saw they have said they are going to sue Ferguson that entered into a consent agreement and then tried to back out. So we're going to enforce the law we're going to change policing practices we're going to change incarceration practices but we're also going to emphasize education jobs and housing. Look I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America and that includes white communities where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism addiction earlier deaths. People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. This is a remarkable and horrifying fact. And that's why I've come forward with for example a plan to revitalize coal country the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy by the reduction in the use of coal. You know coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering has our country forgotten us? Do people not care about all of our sacrifice? And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities whether they are communities of color whether they are white communities whether they are in any part of our country. I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has the 10-20-30 proposal to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. And you know what? If you look at the numbers there are actually as many if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. So yes I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have you know no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities because we have to focus where the real hurt is. And that's why as president I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that. I strongly support the president's executive actions. I hope the Supreme Court upholds them. I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did. I am against the raids. I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families waking them up in the middle of the night rounding them up. We should be deporting criminals not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country. I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Have been ever since I was in the Senate. I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act. I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007. Senator Sanders voted against it at that time. Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And as president I would expand enormous energy literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade. Hopefully after the 2016 election some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country. And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform. Two quick responses. One with respect to the Central American children I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers. I've also called for the end of family detention for the end of privately-run detention centers along with private prisons which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law. And with respect to the 2007 bill this was Ted Kennedy's bill. And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done. And I was proud to stand with him and support it. Well that just wasn't that just wasn't the fact Senator. The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message because we knew that so many of these children were being abused being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border. So we have a disagreement on this. I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made. I think I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement. We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system. I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways one which you mentioned Senator but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund. I have a slightly different approach though about what we should do with that initially. First rather than expand benefits for everyone I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. I want to take care of women. When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s not very many women worked. And women have been disadvantaged ever since. They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows because when their spouse dies they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment. So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security get more revenue into the program. But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk the ones who yes are cutting their pills in half who don't believe they can make the rent who are worried about what comes next for them. Well Senator look I think we're in vigorous agreement here. We both want to get more revenue in. I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the raising the cap would apply to passive income. That has not been... Well that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen. I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it. So I'm going to come up with the best way forward. We're going to end up in the same place. We're going to get more revenue. I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first. I can't speak for the Koch Brothers you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with that was set up to support President Obama that has now decided that they want to support me. They are the ones who should respond to any questions. Let's talk about our campaigns. I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions. So I'm proud of Senator Sanders and his supporters. I think it's great that Senator Sanders President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run certainly on the Democratic side. That's the way it should be and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is. I think that is the real key here. We both have a lot of small donors. I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side. The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda. It is an agenda in my view that would do great harm to our country. We're going to fight it as hard as we can and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers and others. We are mixing apples and oranges. My 750000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations. I'm very proud. That I think between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country. But the real issue I think that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC like President Obama has which now says it wants to support me. It's not my PAC. If you take donations from Wall Street you can't be independent. I would just say I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever. Now when it mattered he stood up and took on Wall Street. He pushed through and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation the toughest regulations since the 1930's. So let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself would in anyway not take on any vested interested whether it's Wall Street or drug companies or insurance companies or frankly the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people. Well let's just let's just follow up on this because you know I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail no executive too powerful to jail and because of Dodd-Frank we now have in law a process that the president the Federal Reserve and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk. I think that's a major accomplishment. I agree however it doesn't go far enough because what it focuses on are the big banks which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot for good reason. I go further in the plan that I've proposed which has been called the toughest most effective comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face. It was an investment bank Lehman Brothers that contributed to our collapse. It was a big insurance company AIG. It was Countrywide Mortgage. My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be. And I believe that not only Barney Frank Paul Krugman and others have said that what I have proposed is the most effective. It goes in the right direction. We have Dodd-Frank. We can use it to break up the banks if that's appropriate. But let's not kid ourselves. As we speak there are new problems on the horizon. I want to get ahead of those and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these... Absolutely. And you know there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve. There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful in public schools community colleges and colleges and universities. I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have you know and what we don't need anymore. And that's what I intend to do. Look I think we are readier than we used to be but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11 and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough. So we have to go after this both abroad and at home. We have to go after terrorist networks predominantly ISIS that's not the only one but let's focus on that for a minute. We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS. That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in. We have to support the fighters on the ground principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi. We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq like Mosul when they are able to do so. And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters. And we have to take on ISIS online. They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda a celebrator of violence an instigator of attacks using their online presence. Here at home we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal state and local law enforcement. We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources but from sources overseas that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed. But the final thing I want to say about this is the following. You know after 9/11 one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious report it. And we need to do that throughout the country. But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense. They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities and they need to feel not just invited but welcomed within the American society. So when somebody like Donald Trump and others... ...stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims that hurts us at home. It's not only offensive; it's dangerous. And the same goes for overseas where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations. I know how to do that. I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program. And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion. So this has to be looked at overall and we have to go at it from every possible angle. If I could just respond. Two points. One Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime. He voted in favor of regime change with Libya voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do which of course we followed through on. I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016. It's very important we focus on the threats we face today and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in. When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses they are voting not only for the president they are voting for the commander-in-chief. And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are and who is best prepared for dealing with them. As we all remember Senator Obama when he ran against me was against the war in Iraq. And yet when he won he turned to me trusting my judgment my experience to become secretary of state. I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years. You did support a U.N. Security Council approach which we did follow up on. And look I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden. I looked at the evidence. I looked at the intelligence. I got the briefings. I recommended that the president go forward. It was a hard choice. Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that. And at the end of the day it was the president's decision. So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision. I'm proud that I gave him that advice. And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission. Well I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy and we have yet to know who that is. That's fine. That's fine. You know I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas. I think it is fair to say whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are that with respect to China one of the most challenging relationships we have his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America. So if we want to pick and choose and I certainly do people I listen to people I don't listen to people I listen to for certain areas then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world because it's a big complicated world out there. And yes people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States. Well with respect to Syria I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made. The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria. The agreement on a cease-fire though is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to. You know the Russians wanted to buy time. Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. But I would add this. You know the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together. This is incredibly complicated because we've got Iran as a big player in addition to Russia. We have Saudi Arabia Turkey and others who have very important interests in their view. This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria which I think would be a grave mistake. Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me. Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together as he has suggested in the past is equally a nonstarter. So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. And remember the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups. So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria Turkey Lebanon Jordan and the like. So we've got some real work to do and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians. Well I respectfully disagree. I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program. That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement. I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran. Yes they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism. Yes they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East causing even more chaos. Yes they've got to get out of Syria. They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas. They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel. We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us. ... Senator Sanders from a debate in 2008 quote what I said. The question was would you meet with an adversary without conditions? I said no. And in fact in Obama administration we did not meet with anybody without conditions. That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking. Well I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean in the Aegean to try to interdict the smugglers to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union. And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this. With respect to the United States I think our role in NATO our support for the E.U. as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country we should be doing our part. And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U. in particular. This is a humanitarian catastrophe. There is no other description of it. So we do as the United States have to support our friends our allies in Europe. We have to stand with them. We have to provide financial support to them. We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on. And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves. I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said. And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world. I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart his understanding of the need for reconciliation. But I want to I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership because you know today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama. In the past he has called him weak. He has called him a disappointment. He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy. And I just couldn't agree disagree more with those kinds of comments. You know from my perspective maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president... ...who got us out of that... ...put us on firm ground and has sent us into the future. And it is a the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans. I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama. You know Senator what I am concerned about is not disagreement on issues saying that this is what I would rather do I don't agree with the president on that calling the president weak calling him a disappointment calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012 you know I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements. As a senator yes I was a senator. I understand we can disagree on the path forward. But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling. You know we we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics. We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again. But here's the point I want to make tonight. I am not a single-issue candidate and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country. I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism by sexism by discrimination against the LGBT community against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers that's what I want to take on. And here in Wisconsin I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before... ...the American middle class and who are being attacked by ideologues by demagogues. Yes does Wall Street and big financial interests along with drug companies insurance companies big oil all of it have too much influence? You're right. But if we were to stop that tomorrow we would still have the indifference the negligence that we saw in Flint. We would still have racism holding people back. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay. We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday. And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions. So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
2016-02-11 00:00:00,sanders," Well Gwen and Judy thank you very much for hosting this event. And PBS thank you. Nine months ago our campaign began. And when it began we had no political organization no money and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont. A lot has happened in nine months. And what has happened is I think the American people have responded to a series of basic truths and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt which is undermining American democracy which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice. And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers. They are worried to death about the future of their kids. And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. And then in addition to that the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth 2.2 million. We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans. They see kids getting arrested for marijuana getting in prison getting a criminal record while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. No criminal records for them. I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics tired of establishment economics. They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up come together not let the Trumps of the world divide us and say you know what in this great country we need a government that represents all of us not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors. Thank you. Well to put that in a context Judy I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled. In other words the very rich are getting richer almost everybody is going getting poorer. What I believe is the United States in fact should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5000 a year. I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10% and when our infrastructure our roads our bridges our water systems Flint Michigan comes to mind. Our waste water plants our rail our airports in many places are disintegrating. Yeah we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars. ... Of course there will be a limit but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality when the middle class is disappearing you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes in my view the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living. Well let us level with the American people. Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act people are going to lose their MedicAid they're going to lose their CHIP program. I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people. We're not going to dismantle everything. But here is the truth. Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America. We pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing. Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments. What I said and let me repeat it I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to but what I have said and let me repeat it that yes the middle the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5000 dollars. In my view healthcare is a right of all people not a privilege and I will fight for that. That is absolutely inaccurate. Look here is the reality folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. There is one major country the United States which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people far more than our Canadian neighbors who guarantee health care to all people. Please do not tell me that in this country if and here's the if we have the courage to take on the drug companies and have the courage to take on the insurance companies and the medical equipment suppliers if we do that yes we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way. Well Secretary Clinton you're not in the White House yet. And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for. For example all right who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? Roads bridges water systems wastewater plants who denies that? Who denies that real unemployment today including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African-American youth unemployment real is over 50 percent. We need to create jobs. So yes I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero zero in federal income tax. Yes I'm going to do away with that. We will use those proceeds a hundred billion a year to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. Yes I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession Great Depression. Yes I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out yes they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We bailed them out. Now it is their time to help the middle class. A brief response. Here is where we are with public education. A 100 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said you know what working class kids low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. Like rich kids they deserve to get a free education. And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. The world has changed. This is 2016. In many ways a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 60 years ago. So yes I do believe that when we talk about public education in America today in a rapidly changing world we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families. Look we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women from men straight gay African-Americans Latinos Asian-Americans. We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class. I am very proud if my memory is not correct I think I am that I have a lifetime and I've been in Congress a few years a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record. I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women. I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. And we will join the rest of the other the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families. Well you know I think from a historical point of view somebody with my background somebody with my views somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment as well. Let me concur with the secretary no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country. And I will tell you something that really galls me. I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. Just a little bit. All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. Government is the enemy. We're going to cut Social Security to help you. We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid federal aid to education to help you because the government is so terrible. But by the way when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice ah in that case my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America. If that's not hypocrisy I don't know what hypocrisy is. This is one of the great tragedies in our country today. And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug. It has to be dealt with. Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail. That is beyond unspeakable. So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system. What we have to do is end over-policing in African-American neighborhoods. The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates. The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites. We need fundamental police reform clearly clearly when we talk about a criminal justice system. I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people often African-Americans shot by police officers. What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will in fact be held accountable. Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with. This mandatory sentencing a very bad idea. It takes away discretion from judges. We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies. We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. And where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see. People are being released from jail without the education without the job training without the resources that they need to get their lives together then they end up we're shocked that they end up back in jail again. So we have a lot of work to do. But here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign and it's really not a very radical pledge. When we have more people in jail disproportionately African American and Latino than China does a communist authoritarian society four times our size. Here's my promise at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country. We will invest in education and jobs for our kids not incarceration and more jails. Well I think Judy what has to be appreciated is that as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street millions of lives were hurt. People lost their jobs their homes their life savings. Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. As I understand it the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse. So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration which by the way leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother clearly we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly in America today in our economy a whole lot of those poor people are African-American. Absolutely because what we will do is say instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners. We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education. And I think when you give low-income kids African-American white Latino kids the opportunities to get their lives together they are not going to end up in jail. They're going to end up in the productive economy which is where we want them. White people? Yeah you can because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages and high unemployment and poor educational opportunities but they face other problems as well. So yes we can talk about it as a racial issue. But it is a general economic issue. And here's what the economic issue is. The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less whether you are white or black than they used to be. Why is that? Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues. But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country throw millions of people out on the street. Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. But you know what you can make a middle class wage you have decent health care decent benefits. You once had a pension. Those jobs in many cases are now gone. They're off to China. Now you are a worker white worker black worker who had a decent job that manufacturing job is gone. What have you got now? You are working at McDonald's? That is why there is massive despair all over this country. People have worked their entire lives. They're making a half two-thirds what they used to make. Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. And that's why this study which shows that if you can believe it today for white working class people between 45 and 54 life expectancy is actually going down. Suicide alcoholism drugs that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power. The answer is yes. We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country. I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported. I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform something that I strongly supported. I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship. I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress the House was unable or refused to act. And in fact I would go further. What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform Judy is to bring families together not divide them up. And let me say this also. Somebody who is very fond of the president agrees with him most of the time I disagree with his recent deportation policies. And I would not support those. Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people if Congress doesn't do the right thing we use the executive orders of the president. Secretary Clinton I do have a disagreement here. If my memory is correct I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country. That was not as I understand it the secretary's position. In terms of 2007 immigration reform yeah I did vote against it. I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center among other groups said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery. Akin to slavery where people came into this country to do guest work were abused were exploited and if they stood up for their rights they'd be thrown out of this country. So it wasn't just me who opposed it. It was LULAC one of the large Latino organizations in this country. It was the AFL-CIO. It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason. But we are where we are right now. And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up. What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people. Well let me just respond. I worked with Ted Kennedy. He was the chairman of my committee. And I loved Ted Kennedy. But on this issue when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no and you have leading progressive Democrats in fact voting no I don't apologize for that vote. But in terms of the children I don't know to whom you're sending a message. Who are you sending a message to? These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake. That was the fact. I don't think we use them to send a message. I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together. OK. You know you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has but by how you treat we treat the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation. And by those standards we're not doing particularly well. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth. And in terms of seniors there are millions of seniors and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country who are trying to get by on $11000 $12000 $13000 a year Social Security. And you know what? You do the arithmetic. You can't get by on $11000 $12000 $13000 a year. And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference. I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund starting at $250000. And when we and when we do that we don't do what the Republicans want which is to cut Social Security. We do what the American people want to expand Social Security by $1300 a year for people under $16000 and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. Yes the wealthiest people the top 1.5 percent will pay more in taxes. But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half where they don't have decent nutrition where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime. That is not what America should be about. If elected president I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits not just for seniors but for disabled veterans as well. In all due respect... ...In all due respect Secretary Clinton a lot of the progressive groups the online groups have really asked you a simple question. Are you coming onboard a proposal? And what is that proposal? Now the proposal that I have outlined you know should be familiar to you because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008. You opposed him then. I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do. We're asking the top 1.5 percent including passive income to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity. I hope you will make a decision soon on this. That's my bill. Check it out. What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system that's what we're talking about. We have to be honest about it. It is undermining American democracy. When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs and in many cases in this campaign Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have OK? We had a decision to make early on do we do a Super PAC? And we said no. We don't represent Wall Street we don't represent the billionaire class so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC. But what we did is we said to the working families of this country look we know things are tough but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics and establishment economics send us something. And it turns out that up until and this has blown me away never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people. Now Secretary Clinton's Super PAC as I understand it received $25 million dollars last reporting period $15 million dollars from Wall Street. Our average contribution is $27 dollars I'm very proud of that. The people aren't dumb. Why in God's name does Wall Street... But let's not but let's not let's not insult let's not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren't dumb. Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around. Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions? Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Why does the fossil fuel industry pay spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions? Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system? And when we talk about Wall Street let's talk about Wall Street. I voted for Dodd-Frank got an important amendment in it. In my view it doesn't go anywhere near far enough. But when we talk about Wall Street you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash. No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted. Let me you know again respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here. When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages look I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today that great trust-buster would have said break them up. I think he would have been right. I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation. I think that would have been right as well. That's my view. Hey I'm in the United States Senate and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very very mistaken. I believe in government but I believe in efficient government not wasteful government. If I could just answer that we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited. And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities. Let me let me just say this. What a President of the United States has got to do and what is his or her major I think responsibility is to a make certain that we keep our people safe that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them. And if you go to my Web siteberniesanders.com what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House in fact did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. Now I think an area in kind of a vague way or not so vague where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change. Look the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States certainly working with our allies we can overthrow dictators all over the world. And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to. We got rid of Gadhafi. But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator it's to understand what happens the day after. And in Libya for example the United States Secretary Clinton as secretary of state working with some other countries did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi. But what happened is a political vacuum developed. ISIS came in and now occupies significant territory in Libya and is now prepared unless we stop them to have a terrorist foothold. But this is nothing new. This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments. Mossadegh back in 1953. Nobody knows who Mossadegh was democratically-elected prime minister of Iran. He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British. And as a result of that the shah of Iran came in terrible dictator. The result of that you had the Iranian Revolution coming in and that is where we are today. Unintended consequences. So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences. I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. Judy if I can there is no question Secretary Clinton and I are friends and I have a lot of respect for her that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs. Secretary of state for four years. You've got a bit of experience I would imagine. But judgment matters as well. Judgment matters as well. And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq. I lead the opposition against it. She voted for it. But more importantly in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before this was a virtually unanimous consent. Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy of course we all wanted to do that. That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change which I did not support. Judy one area very briefly... Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference in the last debate and I believe in her book very good book by the way in her book and in this last debate she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger. Now I find it rather amazing because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country. I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger. And in fact Kissinger's actions in Cambodia when the United States bombed that country overthrew Prince Sihanouk created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in who then butchered some 3 million innocent people one of the worst genocides in the history of the world. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger. Well it ain't Henry Kissinger. That's for sure. It is. I find I mean it's just a very different you know historical perspective here. Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory. Not everybody remembers that. You do. I do. The domino theory you know if Vietnam goes China da da da da da da da. That's what he talked about the great threat of China. And then after the war this is the guy who in fact yes you're right he opened up relations with China and now pushed various type of trade agreements resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China. The terrible authoritarian Communist dictatorship he warned us about now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China. Not my kind of guy. Well this is what I would say. It is a complicated relationship. I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement. As you've indicated what is happening in Syria the number of people the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed men women 20000 children the people who are forced to flee their own country their own country it is unspeakable. It is a real horror. Now what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO correctly I believe are saying you know what we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression. Let me just just say this. For a start the secretary and I disagree and I think the president does not agree with her in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria. I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there as I mentioned a moment ago. I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement. Let's hope that it holds. But furthermore what we have got to do I'm sorry yes I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can and it will not happen tomorrow. But I do hope that in years to come just as occurred with Cuba 10 20 years ago people would say reach normalized relations with Cuba. And by the way I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well. But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world yes that is something I want to achieve. And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive to be principled but to have the goal of trying to improve relations. That's how you make peace in the world. You sit down and you work with people you make demands of people in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism. We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do. But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran that you want to talk to our enemies. I have no illusion. Of course you are right. Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world destabilizing areas. Everybody knows that. But our goal is in fact to try over a period of time to in fact deal with our enemies not just ignore that reality. No I think the idea was that president then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents. It's easier to talk to your friends. It's harder to talk to your enemies. I think we should do both. A couple of years ago I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation. And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria. And what a sad sight that was: Men women children forced out of their homes. And Turkey by the way did a very decent thing providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people. It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed for the downtrodden that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say you know what we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing nothing at all. That is not what America is supposed to be about. So I believe that working with Europe and by the way you know we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world. You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia. They have a responsibility as well. But I think this is a worldwide that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan as well. You know Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed country was in incredible despair. And he stood before the American people and he said ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that yes we could get out of that terrible depression. And then what he did is redefine the role of government. You know you had Herbert Hoover before that saying no we got to only worry about the deficit. So what if mass unemployment exists? So what if children are going hungry? That's not the role of the government. And when FDR said ""Yeah it is"" that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs to build homes to feed people to protect the farmers we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish. And kind of that's what I see our campaign is about right now. In this particular moment of serious crises saying to the American people don't give up on the political process. don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us. If we reengage and get involved yeah we can have health care for all people we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. In the same light as the foreign leader Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics. He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects. But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory. Those are two leaders that I admire very much. That is... ...Madam Secretary that is a low blow. I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years. When President Obama came into office we were losing 800000 jobs a month 800000 jobs a month. We had a $1.4 trillion deficit. And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse. As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented I was there in the Senate unprecedented Republican obstructionism we have made enormous progress. But you know what? Last I heard we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president including a president who has done such an extraordinary job. So I have voiced criticisms. You're right. Maybe you haven't. I have. But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism this blurb that you talk about you know what the blurb said? The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process. That's what I said. That is what I believe. President Obama and I are friends. As you know he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator. I have worked for his re-election. His first election and his re-election. But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? Have you ever disagreed with a president? I suspect you may have. Well one of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate. All right look this has been a great debate. A lot of interesting issues have come together. Let me conclude by just saying this. There is no president in my view not Hillary Clinton not Bernie Sanders who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street large campaign donors the corporate media the big money interests in this country alone. This campaign is not just about electing a president. What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans working people who have given up on the political process they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns. Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as you know it's like going to the moon. It ain't going to happen. Low income people who are not involved in the political process.What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent who today have so much economic and political power. Thank you all very much."
2015-12-19 00:00:00,sanders," Good evening. I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent. I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families. I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis one that destroys ISIS but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground. That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together. David let me give you a little bit of background here. The DNC has hired vendors. On two occasions there were breeches in information two months ago. Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign. And when our staffers said ""whoa what's going here?"" They went to the DNC quietly.They went to the vendor and said ""hey something is wrong"" and that was quietly dealt with. None of that information was looked at. Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.A few days ago a similar incident happened. There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up information came to our campaign. In this case our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked at that information. As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person. We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.Thirdly what I have a really problem and as you mentioned - this is a problem I recognize it as a problem. But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign. That is an egregious act. I'm glad that late last night that was resolved. Fourthly I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation an independent investigation about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign. Don't know that. But we need an independent investigation and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.Last point. When we saw the breach two months we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it. And it bothers me very much that rather than working on this issue to resolve it it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later. Absolutely. Yes I apologize. Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters. This is not the type of campaign that we run. And if I find anybody else involved in this they will also be fired. Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton. You know we had this incident before Secretary with your famous e-mails. Right? And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying and I hope you say is when the middle class of this country is disappearing when we have massive income and wealth inequality when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people all the issues that the governor talked about the secretary talked about those are the issues. Media notwithstanding.Those are the issues that the American people want discussed. I hope those are the issues we'll discuss. I'm one of the 77 percent. I think this is a very difficult issue. Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said. Let me tell you what I think we have got to do. I think it's a two-pronged issue. Number one our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS. What is the best way to do it? Well I think there are some differences of opinion here perhaps between the secretary and myself. I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.I do not believe in unilateral American action. I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces major powers and the Muslim nations. I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there in a dangerous and difficult world; one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan. This small country has welcomed in many refugees.And Abdullah said something recently very important. He said ""Yes international terrorism is by definition an international issue but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam. We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."" And I believe he is absolutely right. It's a country in which people choose to buy guns. I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont my guess here in New Hampshire are gun owners. That's the right of people. But this is what I do believe. I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings not only in San Bernardino but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.For example talking about polls a poll recently came out overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check. Who denies that it is crazy... Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable? We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole. In my view we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.I think there is a consensus. I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement. It's a divided country on guns. But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I coming from a state that has virtually no gun control will do my best to bring together. Whoa whoa whoa. Let's calm down a little bit Martin. First of all let's have some rules here commentators. All right. He sure did. Sure did. All right. First off we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus. In 1988 just to set the record straight governor I ran for the U.S. House. We have one House member from Vermont three candidates in the race. One candidate said you know what I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly. Gun people said there were three candidates in the race you vote for one of the others but not Bernie Sanders. I lost that election by three percentage points. Quite likely for that reason. So please do not explain to me coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control. Excuse me. Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people in voting to ban assault weapons voting for instant background checks voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety. Well the answer is obviously if you see suspicious activity you report it. That's kind of a no-brainer. You know somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house I think it's a good idea to call 911. Do it. But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points. What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history. The secretary is right: Our people are fearful. They are anxious on a number of levels. They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America. We all understand that.But you know what else they're anxious about? They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours they're worried about their kids and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent. And they're looking around them and they're looking at Washington and they're saying the rich are getting much richer I'm getting poorer what are you going to do about it? What are you going to do for my kids?And somebody like a Trump comes along and says ""I know the answers. The answer is that all of the Mexicans they're criminals and rapists we've got to hate the Mexicans. Those are your enemies. We hate all the Muslims because all of the Muslims are terrorists. We've got to hate the Muslims."" Meanwhile the rich get richer.So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea. He thinks low wages are a good idea.I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from. Let's create an America that works for all of us not the handful on top. Excuse me. May I have a chance to respond to this issue? Yeah but the rule includes equal -- got it. All right. All right. Let's keep going. OK. Yeah. And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country. I voted against the first Gulf War which set the stage I believe for the second Iraq war. And what I believe right now and I believe this is terribly important is the United States of America cannot succeed or be thought of as the policeman of the world that when there's an international crisis all over the world in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey just call up the American military and the American taxpayers they're going to send the troops.And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem. I have a problem with that Martha. What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition including Russia a well-coordinated effort. But I agree as I mentioned a moment ago with King Abdullah. This is a war for the soul of Islam. The troops on the ground should not be American troops. They should be Muslim troops. I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate have got to contribute the money that we need and the troops that we need to destroy ISIS with American support. My plan is to make it work to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen they one of the wealthiest countries on Earth are going to have to go to war against ISIS. To tell Qatar that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup maybe they should pay attention to ISIS which is at their doorstep. I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this. Our differences are fairly deep on this issue. We disagreed on the war in Iraq. We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney. I voted against the war. But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.Yes we could get rid of Saddam Hussein but that destabilized the entire region. Yes we could get rid of Gadhafi a terrible dictator but that created a vacuum for ISIS. Yes we could get rid of Assad tomorrow but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think yeah regime change is easy getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that you've got to think about what happens the day after. And in my view what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists that in fact we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies in terms of Assad a terrible dictator. But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad. That's the secondary issue. I was not the secretary of state... I happen to think... Secretary Clinton is right. This is a complicated issue. I don't think anyone has a magical solution. But this is what I do believe. Yes of course Assad is a terrible dictator. But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right. The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States. It is ISIS. And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.The major priority right now in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS. And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition including Russia to help us destroy ISIS. And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad hopefully through Democratic elections. First priority destroy ISIS. David... Could I just say -- just say this... Can I just say this... Of course the United States must lead. But the United States is not the policeman of the world. The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. The United States at the same time cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS. ISIS now is the major priority. Let's get rid of Assad later. Let's have a Democratic Syria. But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS. First of all we recognize that we have a rigged economy as you've indicated. Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better off today than we were when Bush left office? Absolutely. But as you've indicated for millions of American workers people in New Hampshire -- all over America they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids. So what do we do? First statement is we tell the billionaire class ""they cannot have it all."" For a start they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes. Second of all what we do is you raise the minimum wage to living wage 15 bucks an hour over the next several years. Next thing we do pay equity for women workers. Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.Next thing that we do real unemployment -- official unemployment 5 percent real employment 10 percent youth unemployment off the charts. We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure our roads our bridges our rail systems we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.Furthermore in a competitive global economy it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world. That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free. No I think they won't. So Hillary and I have a difference. The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary. They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less. And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room which is the greed recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street. When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall we have got to break the large financial institutions up. So I don't think... ... having said that I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street. I don't have a super PAC. I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans. We need an economy that works for the middle class not just a handful of billionaires and I will fight and lead to make that happen. Let me just -- let me just... Let me just jump in. My name was invoked. So with that invocation let me say a few words. Secretary Clinton I don't have a super PAC. I don't get any money from Wall Street. You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street. But most importantly when you look at what happened in the 1990s go to berniesanders.com. I'll advertise my Web site as well. And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan against a guy named Bill Clinton maybe you know him maybe you don't. Against the Republican leadership who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies. What a brilliant idea that would be.Go to YouTube. Find out what I said to Greenspan. At the end of the day if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today and the governor makes a good point about trade anti-trade anti-monopoly activities.Wall Street today has too much political power. It has too much economic power. To get deregulated -- listen to this they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period. Wall Street is a threat to the economy. They've got to be broken up. Yes exactly exactly. Yes well roughly. Let me say this. As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done among other things ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward. Seventeen more million more people have health care. It is a step forward. A step forward.But this is what we also have to say. Not only are deductibles rising 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor. Major crisis and primary health care. Here is the bottom line. Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?Why is it... Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K. 50 percent more than what they pay in France countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases have better health care outcomes. Bottom line. This ties into campaign finance reform. The insurance companies the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress. We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system. It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year. But they will not be paying Martha any private insurance. So it's unfair to say in total... I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance businesses are not paying any private insurance. The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year. And universities. Well Neil I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach. And your point is absolutely well taken. The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation. There are a lot of factors involved in that. And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums. Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members. But... And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary. But bottom line is this is the year 2015. If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce. It is insane to my mind hundreds of thousands of young people today bright qualified people cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them. Millions coming out of school as you indicated deeply in debt. What do we do?My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street raise very substantial sums of money not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt. You have families out there paying 6 percent 8 percent 10 percent on student debt; refinance their homes at 3 percent.What sense is that? So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education. We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago. All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education. May I respond to the critique on the ... I would just... But Secretary Clinton is wrong. As you know because I know you know a lot about health care. You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country. And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal. Now this is getting to be fun. Let me respond to... Let me respond to... Number one most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own. Now when Secretary Clinton says ""I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class"" let me tell you what she is saying. She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.What the legislation is is $1.61 a week. Now you can say that's a tax on the middle class. It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country. I think Secretary Clinton $1.61 a week is a pretty good investment. David thank you. Then (inaudible)... Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand Rosa DeLauro that is the legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave. Well this whole issue concerns me. And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said. But let's be clear. Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth 2.2 million people. Predominantly African-American and Hispanic. We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans. I think and this is not easy but I think we need to make wage a major effort to come together as a country and end institutional racism. We need major major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system. Now what does that mean?Well for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people predominantly African-Americans. It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act. So that it will not be a federal crime. That is why we need to make... That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor. I was a mayor for eight years worked very closely with a great police department. And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing so that the police officers become part of the community and not as we see in some cities an oppressive force.We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity. We need to end minimal sentencing. We need basically to pledge that we're going to invest in this country in jobs and education not more jails and incarceration. Yes. Look this is a tragedy for New Hampshire. It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont. It is a tragedy all over this country. The number of heroin deaths are growing very very significantly. What do we do? Well for a start this may seem like a radical idea but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country where young people are taking them getting hooked and then going to heroin.Second of all and the reason I believe in a health care for all program we need to understand that addiction is a disease not a criminal activity. And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues. When somebody is addicted and seeking help they should not have to wait three four months in order to get that help. They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on. But what... Look the secretary is right. This is a terribly complicated issue. There are no simple solutions. But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes you go back to Mossadegh in Iran you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad. The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.So I think Secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement. I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is. Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me yes she would. And let me by the way take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady but redefined what that role could be.So I thank you very much for that. My wife Jane has been -- way back when before I knew her a foster parent. Many many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed. And she turned around many lives.She is the best parent and grandmother that I know. She has devoted her life when I was mayor of the city of Burlington actually when I first met her we started a youth office which started a after-school programs for kids started a child care center started a youth newspaper. We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.She led that effort. So I think at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners potentially getting into trouble I think we need a forceful advocate for the children for teenagers for the little children to deal with the dysfunctional child care system and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals. Well thank you very much for hosting this debate and let me applaud my colleagues up here. Because I think frankly maybe I'm wrong but on our worst day I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists. My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant. We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn New York. My mother's dream -- and she died very young but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own. She never lived to see that. But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college. We were the first in the family. So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income. And that is why I am pledged if elected president of the United States to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough this great country and our government belong to all of us not just a handful of billionaires. Thank you very much."
2015-12-19 00:00:00,clinton," Well thank you. And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate. You know the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone not just those at the top. That's the job. I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts. From my perspective we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made. They would repeal the Affordable Care Act not improve it. They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations not to the middle class. And they would despite all their tough talk about terrorism continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party what we will do for our country and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.Thank you. I very much appreciate that comment Bernie. It really is important that we go forward on this. I know that you now have your data back and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.Obviously we were distressed when we learned of it because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign we want to reach as many voters as possible and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.And so now that I think you know we have resolved your data we have agreed on an independent inquiry we should move on. Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this. I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us. Well first the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe. I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS. Not to contain them but to defeat them. And it has three parts. First to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.Secondly to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism. And thirdly to do more to keep us safe. Under each of those three parts of my plan I have very specific recommendations about what to do.Obviously in the first we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground. Secondly we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.And then most importantly here at home I think there are three things that we have to get right. We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information. That now includes the internet because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies. They can't see the government as an adversary we can't see them as obstructionists. We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities. Just like Martin I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization. They will be our early warning signal. That's why we need to work with them not demonize them as the Republicans have been doing. Well I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us. Clearly we have to have a very specific set of actions to take. You know when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition I agree with him about that. We've got to build a coalition abroad. We also have to build a coalition at home. Abroad we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS. I know how hard that is. I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that... Yes I'm getting... ... I'm getting to that. Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point which is we need a coalition here at home. Guns in and of themselves in my opinion will not make Americans safer. We lose 33000 people a year already to gun violence arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism. I think what is... Is creating much deeper closer relations and yes coalitions within our own country. The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community. People who we should be welcoming and working with.I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans particularly Donald Trump is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a ""clash of civilizations"" that there is some kind of Western plot or even ""war against Islam"" which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.So guns have to be looked at as its own problem but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States. Yes let's tell the truth Martin. He invoked mine as well. I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well. I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures. And I applaud his record in Maryland. I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine. I have been for the Brady bill I have been against assault weapons. I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity. And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country. I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers to the sellers to the gun lobby.And I would hope Senator Sanders that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity. We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country. It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.We need and only the three of us will do this nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem. And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present. Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing. First what they saw in Paris now what they have seen in San Bernardino. And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions. So what I would say is number one we need to be united against the threats that we face. We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious reporting what you hear. Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help. You know I was a senator from New York after 9/11 and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks. One of the best things that was done and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say we're in this together. You are not our adversary you are our partner. And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears. He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists. So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry. I would not want to go to that point. I would hope that given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement that there could be a Manhattan-like project something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries they've got to be partners. It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after. There must be some way. I don't know enough about the technology Martha to be able to say what it is but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.And maybe the back door is the wrong door and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that. But I also understand when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions how do we prevent attacks -- well if we can't know what someone is planning we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or you know the member of the mosque or the teacher somebody to see something. I just think there's got to be a way and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out. Otherwise law enforcement is blind -- blind before blind during and unfortunately in many instances blind after. So we always have to balance liberty and security privacy and safety but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe. And that's what I hope there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve. Well I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting... I don't think a halt is necessary. What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security through the State Department through our intelligence agencies and we have to have an increased vetting and screening. Now this takes David 18 months to 24 months two years. So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done. But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible. Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve. So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward. And if at the end of 18 months 24 months there are people who have been cleared and I would prioritize widows and orphans and the elderly people who may have relatives families or have nowhere else to go. I would prioritize them.And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees. No. Not at all. I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated. It was a different situation in Afghanistan. We were attacked from Afghanistan. Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan. We went after those who had attacked us. What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that because of the failures in the region including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad led by Maliki there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities as exemplified by ISIS. And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in as opposed to special operators as opposed to trainers because that is exactly what ISIS wants.They've advertised that. They want American troops back in the Middle East. They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them giving them many more targets and giving them a great recruiting opportunity. So I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.And we do have to form a coalition. I know how hard that is. I have formed them. I put together a coalition including Arabs with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran. And you have to really work hard at it.And the final thing I would say bringing Donald Trump back into it if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition. And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult. Well I just think you're asking a question with a false choice. I believe if we lead an air coalition which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army which has had some recent success in Ramadi as you know if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships which were very successful in going after Al Qaida in Iraq if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS. So that's what I'm focused on that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president. Well I just want to quickly add... Martha that -- you know one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces who are continuing to drop barrel bombs and from ISIS. And of course it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians who are also flying in that space. I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012 we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition. A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces. I do not think it would come to that. We are already de-conflicting air space. We know... No I don't think so. I am advocating... I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia. Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago now I think we can have those conversations. The no-fly zone I would hope would be also shared by Russia. If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track where it belongs. That is exactly... That is exactly what I just said and what I just described. And that is important because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that. And you know with all due respect Senator you voted for regime change with respect to Libya. You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution. All of these are very difficult issues. I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time. And of course we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi a despot with American blood on his hands is overturned. But I'll tell you what would have happened if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya you would be looking at Syria. Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation. I think we're missing the point here. We are doing both at the same time. Well I don't agree with that because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad don't believe there is a political diplomatic channel that is ongoing. We now have that. We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path. It's very important we operate on both at the same time. And let me just say a word about coalition-building because I've heard Senator Sanders say this. I know how hard it is to build coalitions. I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria. That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria linking with Hezbollah their proxy in Lebanon would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future. Since he has been making all kinds of comments. I think it's fair to say Assad has killed by last count about 250000 Syrians. The reason we are in the mess we're in that ISIS has the territory it has is because of Assad.I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.And so when we look at these complex problems I wish it could be either/or. I wish we could say yes let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria which creates more terrorists more extremists by the minute.No. We now finally are where we need to be. We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS which is a danger to us as well as the region... SANDERS (?): Secretary... And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria. If the United States does not lead there is not another leader. There is a vacuum. And we have to lead if we're going to be successful. Sorry. Well I've been talking to a lot of these families and this is such an outrage both because it's bad for our economy we're a 70 percent consumption economy people need to feel optimistic and confident they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded and it's bad for our democracy. It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged that has consequences. I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president. They don't want to raise the minimum wage; they don't want to do anything to increase incomes. At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes because people haven't been able to get ahead and the cost of everything from college tuition to prescription drugs has gone up.Of course we have to raise the minimum wage. Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits. And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work. That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making. That's the way to get women's wages up and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities. And there is a lot we can do in college affordability. I have debt-free tuition plans free community college plans getting student debt down. I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down. And there's a lot. You can go to my website... ... hillaryclinton.com and read about it. But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall. This is the election... ... issues they have to respond to. Everybody should. Look I have said I want to be the president for the struggling the striving and the successful. I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share which they have not been doing. I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases. I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector. I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business. My dad was a small businessman a really small business. I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses. So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for it's what I fought for as a senator it's what I will do as president and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody more power to them because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had. OK... Let me respond... Under the rules I have been -- I have been invoked David so let me respond very quickly. Number one... Number one there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire. They started in Iowa. Now you'd have to ask yourself why are they running ads against me? And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda. Secondly I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world. You can go to opensecrets.org and check that. I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street. Now number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors. And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.So you know again the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day. And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and that was Senator Sanders.So if we're going to be talking like this we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American. And if that means taking on Wall Street I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing. Well I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced. Number one we do have more people who have access to health care. We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance. And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26. Those are all really positive developments. But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof. And so what I have proposed number one is a $5000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.Number two I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems. We end up paying the highest prices in the world. And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making Martha. We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now. Yes. Well they're glitches because... It is. Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing. We have fought as Democrats for decades to get a health care plan. I know. I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s. We want to build on it and fix it. And I'm confident we can do that. And it will have effects in the private market. And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.And so people are still going to get health care thankfully in emergency rooms in hospitals. Those costs are then added to the overall cost which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system. Right. Well I have what I call the new college compact. Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game you know. Number one States have been dis-investing in higher education. In fact I think New Hampshire in state tuition for public colleges and universities is among the highest if not the highest in the country. So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons into highways into things other than higher education. So under my compact the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system.Secondly I don't believe in free tuition for everybody. I believe we should focus on middle-class families working families and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. So I have proposed debt free tuition which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. So I put all of this together again on my website and I've gotten such a good response.But I want to quickly say one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. Free college a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion about a 40 percent in the federal budget.And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care to the states to have the states run. And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college. Well the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders... Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state. And my analysis is that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families. I'm the only person... ... saying no middle class tax raises. That's off the table... That is a pledge that I'm making. I made it when I ran in 2008. Yes and it was the same one that President Obama made. Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes. We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001. Since you know the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody. And we've got to get back to where people can save money again where they can invest in their families and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now. Senator I have been -- I have been fighting for paid... ... family leave for a very long time... I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it... ... not everybody else. Well David I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country. We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended. I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect. Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.At the same time we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically. The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders. The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled. We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system but more opportunities more jobs better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust. You know on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign I was in Keene and I was asked ""what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?"" And all over New Hampshire I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose. I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go because there are not enough facilities. So this is a major epidemic and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard. I've had had two town halls one in Keene one in Laconia dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do. And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior how the recovery community is reaching out.And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.So I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together. I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.We need to do more on the prescribing end of it. There are too many opioids being prescribed and that leads directly now to heroin addiction. And we need to change the way we do law enforcement and of course we need more programs and facilities so when somebody is ready to get help there's a place for them to go.And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose Naloxone so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring. Well first let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people. The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not and eventually yes I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi. I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election which elected moderates was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path. Now the whole region has been rendered unstable in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte the home town of Gadhafi and to begin to try to create a national government.You know this is not easy work. We did a lot to help. We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept. But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful. Martha we offered a lot more than they were willing to take. We offered a lot more. We also got rid of their chemical weapons which was a big help and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up. You know we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops which there was never any idea of doing that then to try to send trainers to try to send experts is something we offered Europeans offered the U.N. offered and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first. I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the you know militaristic forces inside that country. But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should. We've been at this a couple of years. Well there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made. But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help. What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done. Well I would just repeat that. Wait a minute. I think it's only fair to put on the record Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote. We got a U.N. Security council vote. Now I understand that this is very difficult. And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia. We saw what happened in Egypt. I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches. One work with the tough men the dictators for our own benefit and promote democracy. That's a hard road to walk. But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel. Well the role has been defined by each person who's held it. And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern. Obviously Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health particularly nutrition and exercise. And I think has had a big impact. So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.And with respect to my own husband I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that. But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions for advice and in particular how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody which he knows a little bit about. On January 20th 2017 the next president of the United States will walk into the White House. If heaven forbid that next president is a Republican I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen. A lot of the rights that have been won over years from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights will be at risk. Social Security which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme may face privatization. Our vets may see the V.A. hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization. Planned Parenthood will be defunded. The list goes on because the differences are so stark.You know everybody says every election's important and there's truth to that. This is a watershed election. I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House. And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.You know I became a grandmother 15 months ago and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future. But as president I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. If you will join me in this campaign we will make that a mission. Thank you good night and may the force be with you."
2015-12-19 00:00:00,raddatz, Good evening to you all. The rules for tonight are very basic and have been agreed to by all three campaigns in advance. Candidates can take up to a minute-and-a-half to respond directly to a question. For a rebuttal for a follow-up 45 seconds will be allowed. There are green yellow and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is running out and when they're supposed to be finished with their answers. Thank you Secretary Clinton. Governor O'Malley? Secretary Clinton in the wake of the San Bernardino attack you all emphasized gun control. But our latest poll shows that more Americans believe arming people not stricter gun laws is the best defense against terrorism. Are they wrong? Secretary Clinton can we stick to gun control? Are they wrong? Senator Sanders -- wait just a moment please Governor O'Malley. Senator Sanders we've seen those long lines of people buying guns in record numbers after the Paris attacks. Would you discourage people from buying a gun? Thank you Senator Sanders. I think we're going to go on... Governor now -- and let me stay with gun control for a minute then. You talk about assault weapons. Even if you were able to ban the purchase of assault weapons tomorrow Americans already own an estimated 7 to 10 million semi-automatic rifles. Would you make it illegal to own those weapons force people to turn them in? And if not how would banning the sales really make a difference? But again I'm not talking about buying. Would you have them confiscated? The ones that are already here? I want to move to another... No no not yet Governor O'Malley. No not yet Governor O'Malley. I'll come to you when we call on you. Thank you very much. You'll be happy. I'll let -- I'll let you talk then. Secretary Clinton I want to talk about a new terrorist tool used in the Paris attacks encryption. FBI Director James Comey says terrorists can hold secret communications which law enforcement cannot get to even with a court order.You've talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together but Apple CEO Tim Cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data. So would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law? And Governor O'Malley where do you draw the line between national security and personal security? Thank you Governor O'Malley. Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders we're going to move on. We're going to move on. We're going to move on to the fight against ISIS. You're the one who told us we have to follow the rules and break it off. OK. Let's keep going. Thank you. Thank you. I do want to move to the fight against ISIS. For the people of New Hampshire the brutality of ISIS is personal. James Foley grew up here. The first hostage a journalist brutally executed last year. You've all said ISIS is a ruthless enemy and must be stopped. Al Qaida as well. Senator Sanders you voted to send U.S. ground forces to fight in the coalition to help destroy Al Qaida in Afghanistan. Can you then explain you why don't support sending U.S. combat troops to join a coalition to fight ISIS? But why Al Qaida why not ISIS? The administration has tried that over and over again. If it doesn't work and this threat is so great what's your plan B? Secretary Clinton you too have ruled out a large U.S. combat force yet you support sending in special operations forces to Syria and sending those 100 to 200 troops to Iraq to do exploitation kill raids. We've already lost one Delta Force member in a raid. It has looked very much to me like we're already in ground combat on frequent trips I've made there.So are you fooling Americans when you say we're not putting American combat troops back into Syria or Iraq? Secretary Clinton I want -- I want to follow up on that. You do support sending special operations forces there. You support what the president has done already. One of the lessons people draw from Vietnam and war since is that a little force can turn into a little more and a little more. President Obama certainly didn't expect to be sending 30000 additional troops into Afghanistan the first year of his presidency. Are you prepared to run the risk of a bigger war to achieve your goals to destroy ISIS or are you prepared to give up on those goals if it requires a larger force? Governor O'Malley. You've emphasized the need for more human intelligence on the ground. What is it our intelligence community is not doing now that needs to be done? Thank you. Secretary Clinton I'd like to go back to that if I could. ISIS doesn't have aircraft Al Qaida doesn't have aircraft. So would you shoot down a Syrian military aircraft or a Russian airplane? But isn't that a decision you should make now whether... ... if you're advocating this? And we're going to move on to health care. Secretary Clinton the Department of Health and Human Services says more than 17 million Americans who are not insured now have health coverage because of Obamacare. But for Americans who already had health insurance the cost has gone up 27 percent in the last five years while deductibles are up 67 percent health care costs are rising faster than many Americans can manage.What's broken in Obamacare that needs to be fixed right now? And what would you do to fix it? But you did say those were glitches. Just glitches? Twenty-seven percent in the last five years deductibles up 67 percent? Senator Sanders I want you to respond to what she was saying but you're instead calling for single-payer health care. You note people won't have to pay deductibles or premiums but they will have to pay new taxes. Can you tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay? Senator Sanders you didn't really tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay... But you can't tell us this specifically even if you were... OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics right here at Saint Anselm college Neil Levesque. Neil? Secretary Clinton I want to circle back to something that your opponents here have brought up. Libya is falling apart. The country is a haven for ISIS and jihadists with an estimated 2000 ISIS fighters there today. You advocated for that 2011 intervention and called it smart power at its best. And yet even President Obama said the U.S. should have done more to fill the leadership vacuum left behind. How much responsibility do you bear for the chaos that followed elections? Secretary Clinton I want to go back. That -- government lacked institutions and experience. It had been a family business for 40 years. On the security side we offered only a modest training effort and a very limited arms buy-back program. Let me ask you the question again. How much responsibility do you bear for the chaos that followed those elections? But were mistakes made? Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton. Quick Governor O'Malley. Thank you very much. Thank you. We're going to move on here. Governor O'Malley thank you very much for that. And we're going to make a very sharp turn as we wrap things up here. Secretary Clinton first ladies as you well know have used their position to work on important causes like literacy and drug abuse. But they also supervise the menus the flowers the holiday ornaments and White House decor. I know you think you know where I'm going here.You have said that Bill Clinton is a great host and loves giving tours but may opt out of picking flower arrangements if you're elected. Bill Clinton aside is it time to change the role of a president's spouse? Governor O'Malley?
2015-12-19 00:00:00,announcer, ABC News coverage of the New Hampshire Democratic debate will continue in a moment.
2015-12-19 00:00:00,muir," We will be tackling many critical issues right here tonight and we begin with opening statements in alphabetical order and Secretary Clinton. Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders thank you and thank you all. We do have a lot of important issues to get here tonight and we want to address the controversy of the last 24 hours right off the top because we heard some of the most heated rhetoric of the campaign so far between two of the campaigns on this stage tonight.Senator Sanders you fired a campaign staffer you have sued the Democratic National Committee; all of this after your campaign acknowledge that some of your staffers quote ""irresponsibly accessed data from another campaign."" The Clinton campaign called this a very egregious breech of data of ethics and said quote ""our data was stolen.""Did they overstate this or were your staffers essentially stealing part of the Clinton playbook? But Senator you do mention the DNC -- the vender. But you said of your staff that they did the wrong thing. So does Secretary Clinton deserve an apology tonight? Secretary Clinton... Secretary Clinton he has apologized. How do your react? (?): All three candidates are weighing in. Good let's move on -- Senator Sanders let's move on right to some of those issues. It is just six days before Christmas as we all know in this country. It's typically a joyful time as it is this year as well. But it's also an anxious time. President Obama has acknowledged that what we saw in San Bernardino was an act of terrorism. But we remember the president said right before Thanksgiving there is no known specific and credible intelligence indicating a plot on the homeland.We now know that this couple had assembled an arsenal. They were not on law enforcement's radar. They were completely undetected. So as we approach another holiday with the president again saying late this week no credible threat Secretary Clinton how confident should the American people be that there aren't others like that couple right now in the U.S. going undetected?And what would you do as president to find them? (inaudible) Thank you. And we're going to break down these issues tonight but I do want to go to Senator Sanders because the concern going into Christmas is significant as you know. A new ABC News poll shows 77 percent of Americans have little or no confidence in the government's ability to prevent a lone wolf attack. How would you specifically find would-be terrorist who are going undetected? Senator thank you. Governor we have to abide the rules here we'll call on you here shortly but... But I do want pick up on something... We will. But let me just establish that for you senator. Really quickly governor we are going to call on you tonight and it's very clear you have a lot to say but please wait until you're called upon. And senator he invoked your record and I'll let you respond. I'll let you respond. And you will get some to as well. Senator thank you. I want to move on here. Secretary Clinton you brought up Donald Trump a short time ago. Secretary Clinton thank you. We're going to move on from guns here and go back to something you mentioned a short time ago. You brought up Donald Trump first here this evening. We've now seen the polling done well after his proposed ban on Muslims coming to America. Thirty-six percent of Americans more than a third agree with him. You have weighed in already on Donald Trump. You've weighed in on the proposed ban. But what would you say to the millions of Americans watching tonight who agree with him? Are they wrong? Secretary thank you. Senator Sanders I did want to ask you about a neighbor in San Bernardino who reportedly witnessed packages being delivered to that couple's home that it set off red flags but they didn't report it because they were afraid to profile. What would you say to Americans afraid to profile? Is it ever acceptable? But I'm asking about -- I'm asking about profiling. Because a lot of people are afraid of that. Senator thank you. Martha we're going to turn now to refugees coming to America. And on the subject of refugees more than half of all Americans now say they oppose taking in refugees from Syria and across the Middle East. Secretary Clinton you have said that it would undermine who we are as Americans shutting our doors. But New Hampshire's governor where we are right here tonight a democrat and a supporter of yours is among more than 30 governors who are now concerned. Governor Maggie Hassan says ""we should halt acceptance of Syrian refugees until U.S. authorities can assure the vetting process halt Syrian refugees."" Is she wrong? But a halt? Governor O'Malley obviously you were governor yourself at one time. What would you say to New Hampshire's governor tonight? Is she wrong on this? So the idea of a halt or a pause? Governor thank you. I want to take this to Senator -- I'm going to take this to Senator Sanders next because I think there... Senator thank you. Yeah but Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton... Senator Sanders Senator Sanders hold on. One moment please. I'm going to ask the secretary here because there does appear to be some daylight here between the policies at least in respect to when you take out Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Right now or do you wait? Do you tackle ISIS first? You have said Secretary Clinton that you come to the conclusion that we have to proceed on both fronts at once. We heard from the senator just this week that we must put aside the issue of how quickly we get rid of Assad and come together with countries including Russia and Iran to destroy ISIS first. Is he wrong? But that's what he's saying we should put that aside for now and go after ISIS. She says we have to proceed on both fronts at once. Senator Sanders thank you. Governor O'Malley? But -- you criticized -- you criticized Secretary Clinton for what came next. What's your proposal for what comes after Assad? Senator Sanders please. Go ahead. Senator Sanders a last word on this. Senator Sanders thank you. When we come back here tonight the other major issues of this election: jobs the economy health care. Which candidates will make the best case for the middle class as our coverage of the Democratic debate here in New Hampshire continues right after this on ABC. Welcome back tonight. As you can see we have a packed audience here in New Hampshire and we're going to continue. We've already had a spirited conversation here at the top of the broadcast about ISIS about the concerns of terror here on the home front and as we await Secretary Clinton backstage we're going to begin on the economy. We want to turn to the American jobs wages and raises in this country. And we believe Secretary Clinton will be coming around the corner any minute. But in the mean time we want to start with this eye-opening number. And Senator Sanders this question goes to you first anyway.In 1995 the median American household income was $52600 in today's money. This year it's $53600. That's 20 more years on the job with just a 2 percent raise. In a similar time-frame raises for CEOs went up more than 200 percent. We're going to continue here and Secretary you'll get a chance on this too. But as I pointed out the CEO pay 200 percent of their time -- for that family of just 2 percent. You've all said ""you would raise the minimum wage."" But Senator Sanders what else - speak to that household tonight. 20 years just a 2 percent raise how as president would you get them a raise right away? Senator Sanders thank you. Governor O'Malley what would propose that would be different how would you get the middle class a raise and without waiting another 20 years for another 2 percent. Governor thank you. Secretary Clinton... As you were walking in I was talking about the median American household getting a two percent raise over the last 20 years that CEO pay in that same time frame has gone up 200 percent. So for those families watching tonight how do you get them a raise if you're president? Secretary... Secretary thank you. We're going to -- we're going to... And we're going to talk about college education in a moment. But Secretary Clinton I did want to ask you the last time you ran for president Fortune Magazine put you on its cover with the headline Business Loves Hillary pointing out your support for many CEOs in corporate America. I'm curious eight years later should corporate America love Hillary Clinton? Secretary thank you. Senator Sanders... I want to stay on this and ask you how big a role does corporate America play in a healthy economy and will corporate America love a President Sanders? Senator thank you. I want to... Governor let me just ask you though because it is an important question how important a role do you think corporate America plays in a healthy economy here in the U.S.? Governor O'Malley thank you. I do want to ask you Secretary Clinton. Let me just ask you... We did -- we did -- Secretary Clinton let me just ask you... And in particular... Secretary Clinton thank you. Senator? Senator Sanders... Thank you Senator. Secretary Clinton. We're going to get right into this Senator but I want to ask about taxes next. This is included. She was asking about that... Are we back on health care - Secretary Clinton hold one moment. Senator Sanders... Secretary Clinton please. So let's ask about it. Secretary Clinton let's turn to the taxes. This is where we are going next we are going next to taxes here... This is fun. applause ]This is democracy at work. Secretary Clinton let me ask you about your tax plan because from the crushing cost of college education the next question most families have; is will my taxes go up under the next president? You have said it's your goal not to raise taxes on families making under $200000 a year a goal. But can you say that's a promise as you stand here tonight? A promise? Secretary Clinton... Please. Senator thank you. Let me bring in Governor O'Malley... You've heard... Secretary Clinton. Thank you. I want to bring in Governor O'Malley on this. We heard the promise from Secretary Clinton because people want to know about their taxes will they go up. She has now promised here tonight not to raise them on families making $250000 or less. Can you make that same promise if you're elected? Governor O'Malley thank you. A spirited debate on taxes. And there will be more with the Democratic debate in New Hampshire when we come back right here on ABC. More in a moment. Welcome back tonight to New Hampshire. The Democratic debate continues here on ABC. And Secretary Clinton we want to turn to race now in America. There is a real concern in this country from Black Lives Matter and from other community groups that we're just now seeing with smartphones and cell phones what many have been dealing with for years when they come in contact with police.But you also have many in law enforcement who now say there has been a so-called Ferguson effect police holding back because they're afraid of backlash. In fact the FBI director is calling it a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement. So if elected president how would you bridge the divide between the two? Secretary thank you. Governor O'Malley how would you bridge the divide? Governor thank you. And Senator Sanders when you hear the FBI director calling it a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement does that concern you as well when you -- Senator thank you. We want to turn now to an issue. This next issue has destroyed so many families across the country and in particular right here in New Hampshire heroin. And there's a stunning new figure out. A recent poll -- 48 percent here in this state alone say they know someone who has abused heroin.We're going to turn tonight to Dan Tuohy of the New Hampshire Union Leader who has this question. Senator Sanders I'm going to take this to you first because you've seen what's happened with heroin right on the border in your own state. Senator thank you. Secretary Clinton? Secretary thank you. Governor O'Malley thank you. Martha? I do want to follow up here for each of you. And a similar line of questioning. Senator Sanders your wife Jane shares an office at your campaign headquarters in Burlington. We've seen the pictures the desks right next to each other. Would she have a desk close by in the west wing? Senator thank you. Governor O'Malley -- Governor O'Malley you have talked about your wife Katie here tonight. She's a district court judge. And the question for you is would she have to give that up as first lady or will she share an office in the west wing as well? Governor O'Malley thank you (inaudible). Governor thank you. We'll be back with much more from New Hampshire. The Democratic debate continues right after this. Welcome back tonight. It's been an evening of lively discussion among the candidates and it's time for closing statements. We began in alphabetical order so we'll reverse the order at the end and begin with you Senator Sanders. Governor thank you. Secretary Clinton?"
2015-12-19 00:00:00,question, : New Hampshire has been hard hit by the heroin epidemic and we're on track to have twice as many overdose deaths this year as in 2013. What specifically would you do to address this crisis?
2015-12-19 00:00:00,moderators, Martha Raddatz (ABC News) David Muir (ABC News)
2015-12-19 00:00:00,mcelveen, Secretary Clinton how does your plan differentiate from your opponents? Thank you Secretary Clinton thank you. Back to you David.
2015-12-19 00:00:00,levesque, Here to New Hampshire again. As you know this auditorium is filled with many Saint Anselm college students. They know the outstanding student debt right now in America is $1.3 trillion. That private education costs have gone up in the last decade 26 percent and 40 percent for public education. So knowing that we know you want to make public education more affordable but how do you really lower the cost? Senator Sanders you mentioned a few minutes ago that you want free tuition for public colleges. How does that really lower the cost other than just shifting the cost to taxpayers? Governor O'Malley how do you propose -- Governor O'Malley how do you propose lowering some of these costs associated with higher education?
2015-12-19 00:00:00,o'malley," Martha thank you. Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far because tonight is different because of this reason that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists American lives taken from us. So yes we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States. I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday. And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors I also looked in the eyes of veterans. I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts. I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.What our nation needs right now is to realize that while we face a terrible danger we also face a different sort of political danger. And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other. What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy. But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us which means we must never surrender them to terrorists must never surrender our Americans values to racist must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.We are a better country than this. Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence it is the Statue of Liberty. And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together. Yeah David look for crying out loud our country has been attacked we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare. Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind. You want to know why things don't get done in Washington? Because for the last 24 hours with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.Instead we're listening to the bickering back and forth. Maybe that is normal politics in Washington but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.We need to address our security issues we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table. And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward. David I am the very first... I am the very first post-9/11 mayor and the very first post-9/11 governor. I understand from the ground up that when attacks like San Bernardino happen when attacks like the attacks of 9/11 happen that when people call 911 the first people to show up are the local first responders. Many of the things Secretary Clinton said are absolutely true but they underscore a lack of investment that we have as a nation failed to make over these last 15 years in intelligence gathering intelligence analysis intelligence sharing. Not only in theater in Syria and Iraq and other places where we embalk ourselves in toppling dictators without having any idea what comes next but here in the homeland as we protect people from this threat of the lone wolves and these changing tactics and strategies.I believe that what's happened here is that the president had us on the right course but it's a lack of battle tempo. We have to increase the battle tempo we have to bring a modern way of getting things done and forcing the sharing of information and do a much better job of acting on it in order to prevent these sorts of attacks in the future. Martha if I may... Excuse me no. I am the only person on this stage who has actually... ... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons David. And look there are profound differences... Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill. Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers. And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year it seems having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.Look what we need on this issue is not more polls. We need more principle. When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show then we should all be waking up. We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons. Because Martha it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons. You know we are the only nation only developed nation on the planet... No Martha I would not. And that's not what we did in Maryland. But you know what we did in Maryland? We overcame the NRA's objections. We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there. We did our own rallies. And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way we can address a major vulnerability in our country. ISIL videos ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.And it's because of the flip-flopping political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years. I am telling the truth. Martha may I -- Martha may I... Can I share this quick story? Oh. All right. When you come back to me I'll share that story. I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security. We need to figure this out together. We need a collaborative approach. We need new leadership. The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out. The federal government should have to get warrants. That's not some sort of pass you know antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.My friend Kashif who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves. He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night. And he is a proud American Muslim. And one of his little boys said to him ""Dad what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?"" These are very very real issues. this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship freedom of religion freedom of expression. And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump. No what I would say is this is look I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65000 refugees we were asked to accept. And if this humanitarian crisis increases we should accept more. David there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees. I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year 18 months 24 months. There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through. We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers. What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria when ISIS moves into their town they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition and that tells the family you'd better get out now. The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering these are not the perpetrators. We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty and we need to act like the great country we are according to our values. Well we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground. And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence; I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence. I mean we've seen time and time again especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward. So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly the role of sustainable development in all of this. As president I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member. We have to act in a much more whole of government approach as General Dempsey said.And I do believe and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues this is a genocidal threat. They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq. We cannot allow safe havens and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats because Martha this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia. We need to pay attention here in Central America as well. So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions. I'd like to offer a... May I offer a different generation's perspective on this? During the Cold War -- during the Cold War we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists and who was wearing the U.S. jersey. We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies old methodologies to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States. Look what we did in Iran with Mossadegh. And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that. I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this and we need to restrain ourselves. I mean I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart. And the world no doubt is a better place without him. But look we didn't know what was happening next. And we fell into the same trap with Assad saying -- as if it's our job to say Assad must go.We have a role to play in this world. But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind. I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL. That is the clear and present danger. And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution and we should create as Secretary Clinton indicated and I agree with that that there should be a political process. But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go. Where did it ever say in the Constitution where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?We have a role to play in this world. But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy. Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession. We actually passed a living wage. We raised the minimum wage. We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state. All through the recession we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families. How? By actually doing more for education. We increased education funding by 37 percent.We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition. We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future. We created 2000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices. So David the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes they weren't dreams they weren't amorphous goals out there. We actually took action to do these things and as president I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families. Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment. And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work. Look I look at our economy as an ecosystem. And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate the more our workers earn the more they will spend the more our economy will grow. And most heads of businesses -- large medium and small -- understand that. But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage. We're not going to fix what ails our economy we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which by the way the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.And for my part I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never ever has. In fact in the last debate very shamefully she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition. There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.And the worst type of concentration Secretary Clinton is the concentration of the big banks the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them oh you weren't responsible for the crash not by a long shot.And that's why today you still cannot support as I do breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall like we had in late 1999 before it was repealed and led to the crash where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes. And I was on the front lines of that looking into the eyes of my neighbors... Yes this one falls under the category of I have actually done this. As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition. My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees. So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants. Yes we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.But states need to do more as well. And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well. I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.I'm joined tonight by two daughters Tara and Grace. My oldest daughter's a teacher. Um and their mother's here as well. We were proud of them on graduation day weren't we Katie? And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.I mean we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones. There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan. I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I. Bill.But today we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills. That's a drag on the economy. It's one of the key investments we need to make. I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers. And in our party unlike the Republican party we actually believe that the more our people learn the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid. No I've never made a promise like that. But unlike either of these two fine people I've actually balanced a budget every single year. I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating. By the time I left the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started. But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent. David look this is the big -- I agree by the way that we should have paid family leave. And I agree with Senator Sanders on that. And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.But look there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us those earning more than a million dollars feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college debt-free college cutting youth unemployment in half investing in our cities again.So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up. That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans and we can do it and we know how. There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing of law enforcement criminal justice and race in America. When I ran in 1999 David for mayor of Baltimore our city by that year had become the most addicted violent and abandoned in America. But we came together. I brought people together over some very deep racial divides. And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.As governor we continued to work together. We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows. But get this. We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows. So it is possible actually to find the things that actually work that we did increasing drug treatment using big data to better protect the lives of young people cut juvenile crime in half and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police. We reported excessive force discourtesy use of lethal force. In fact drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.As a nation we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open more transparent and more accountable. Just as we require every major department every county to report its major crimes we should require police departments to report their discourtesy brutality excessive force.There's so much work that can be done so much we've learned to do better. We need to do it now as a nation. This is our time and our opportunity to do that. And you know I actually know a great deal about this issue. And I have a dear friend played music with him for years remember when his -- when he came home with his baby girl and now she's no longer with us because of addiction and overdose. The last time in New Hampshire I had to take a break shortly after landing and call home and comfort a friend whose mother had died of an overdose. Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens. It's a huge public health challenge. In our own city I mentioned before we had become the most addicted city in America. But together every single year I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work intervening earlier understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction the over-prescribing.I agree we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment. We have to invest in the local partnerships and the best place to intervene the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction is at the hospital. That very first time they show up with a near miss we should be intervening there. That's what I said to my own public health people. What would we do if this were Ebola? How would we act?So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills and yet we refuse to act. There are thing that can be done. Go on to my website. My plan is there. It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years. Martha -- I would just repeat that -- And Martha... ... and in this case we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region. And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence. We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up. That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do. But without the tools without the support that was needed to that. And now what we have is a whole stretch now of the coast of Libya 100 miles 150 miles that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL. They go back and forth between Syria and this region. We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop. Well that would be totally up to her. I mean Katie has never been a person who let her husband's professional choices get in the way of following her dreams. And I think she got that from her mother actually. The -- and I readily admit that she is a far more accomplished lawyer than I was ever able to become before I took my detour. She is a district court judge in Maryland. She puts in a full day there. We've raised four terrific kids. And yet when she was first lady of the state not only would she go to work every day and sit there through a lot of sad and gut-wrenching cases but then she'd put in additional time being an advocate against domestic violence.Maryland made great strides on that because of her advocacy and her understanding of how the court process works. She was an advocate against bullying and implementing anti-bullying things. So Katie O'Malley will do whatever Katie O'Malley wants to do regardless of her husband's success in getting elected president. Thank you. Martha thank you. I want to thank all of the people who have tuned in tonight. I want to thank the great people of New Hampshire where despite all of the cynicism about big money and big banks taking over our politics here in New Hampshire the individual matters. You know my wife Katie and I have four terrific kids and like you there's probably nothing we wouldn't do to give them a future that's safer that's healthier where they have more opportunity than our parents and grandparents gave to us. Tonight what you listened to was a healthy exchange of ideas about how we'd do that that which we have always proven the capacity to do better than any nation in the world to take actions that include more of our people more fully in the economic social and political life of our country.When you listened to the Republican debate the other night you heard a lot of anger and you had a lot of fear. Well they can have their anger and they can have their fear but anger and fear never built America. We build our country by adopting wage and labor policies including comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway of citizenship for all. We do it by investing in our country by investing in infrastructure by investing in the skills and the talents of our people with debt-free college and we can do it again.And we also create a better future for our kids when we square our shoulders to the great challenges of our times whether it's terror trying to undermine our values or Republican presidential candidates trying to get us to surrender our freedoms and our values in the face of this threat.The other big challenge we have is climate change. The greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years. We need to embrace this. I have put forward a plan that does this that moves us to 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. Join this campaign for the future. New leadership is what our country needs to move us out of these divided and polarized times. Thank you."
2016-01-17 00:00:00,sanders," Thank you. As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. it's important not only that we remember what he stood for but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. As we look out at our country today what the American people understand is we have an economy that's rigged that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages 47 million people living in poverty and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent. And then to make a bad situation worse we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president but to transform this country. Well that's what our campaign is about. It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world we should have health care for every man woman and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. So what my first days are about is bringing America together to end the decline of the middle class to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us and not just big campaign contributors. Well I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I was in 1988 there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons. I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. And that includes people of criminal backgrounds people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant.We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together.And by the way as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible... What I have said is that gun manufacturer's liability bill has some good provisions among other things we've prohibited ammunition that would've killed cops who had protection on. We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation. And what we also said ""is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun."" So what I said is "" I would re-look at it."" We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions. ...Well I look... ... Let me respond to what the secretary said. We have a criminal justice system which is broken. Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth including China? Disproportionately African American and Latino. Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed or underemployed? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEO's of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records. ... We need to take a very hard look at our... ... criminal justice system investing in jobs and education not in jails and incarceration . Well let me talk about polling. As Secretary Clinton well knows when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what? In Iowa New Hampshire the race is very very close. Maybe we're ahead New Hampshire. In terms of polling guess what? We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton. In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend Donald Trump beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.To answer your question. When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda and with our views on the economy and criminal justice just as the general population has become more supportive so will the African American community so will the Latino community. We have the momentum we're on a path to a victory. I apologize for not hearing all of that question. Yes. Absolutely. This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general's investigation. Second of all and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers the vast majority of whom are honest hard- working people trying to do a difficult job but let us be clear.If a police officer breaks the law like any public official that officer must be held accountable. And thirdly we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they don't look like occupying armies. We've got to move toward community policing.And fourthly we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. Sure. I agree... I agree with everything the Secretary said but let me just add this there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.And second of all when we talk about addiction being a disease the Secretary is right what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment. People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it not two months from now which is why I believe in universal... ... healthcare with mental health... ... a part of that. OK. Secretary Secretary Clinton didn't answer your question. Because what her campaign was saying Bernie Sanders who has fought for universal health care for my entire life he wants to end Medicare end Medicaid end the children's health insurance program. That is nonsense.What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man woman and child as a right. Now the truth is that Frank Delano Roosevelt Harry Truman do you know what they believed in? They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.I'm on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act. I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation. I voted for it but right now what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs getting ripped off.And here's the important point we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal provide health care to all people get private insurance out of health insurance lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5000 bucks.That's the vision we need to take. But what if we have... It is it is absolutely inaccurate. No one is tearing this up we're going to go forward. But with the secretary neglected to mention not just the 29 million still have no health insurance that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles. Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British who guarantee health care to all of their people? Fifty percent more than the French more than the Canadians. The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.We're not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it. But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for-all system. Yeah. Yes. Not all that detailed. Well. Well that's you might want to ask... Andrea let me just say this. Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it. I'm not the governor. I'm the senator from the state of Vermont. But second of all second of all... ... here is what the real point is in terms of all of the issues you've raised the good questions you've raised. You know what it all comes down to?Do you know why we can't do what every other country major country on Earth is doing? It's because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt we have super PACs we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying and the private insurance companies as well.What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward it's Medicare for all it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money and the pharmaceutical industry. That's what this debate should be about. A couple of years ago when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veteran's health care legislation in modern history. But let me rephrase your question because I think in all do respect you're expression. In all do respect you're missing the main point. And the main point in the Congress it's not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.That's a mythology from the media. The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do. The real issue is that in area after area raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour. The American people want it. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure creating 13 million jobs the American people want it. The pay equity for women the American people want it. Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes. The American people want it. The point is we have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people not big money. I do. Did I say that? Because of what I believe in what I was just saying. The Democratic party needs major reform. To those of you in South Carolina you know what in Mississippi we need a 50-state strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need. Instead of being dependent on super PACs what we need is to be dependent on small individual campaign contributors. We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low-income people. Not wealthy campaign contributors. We need to expand what the input into the Democratic party. I am very proud that in this campaign we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people from working people. We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point. And I respectfully disagree. And I respectfully disagree with my friend over here. And that is you are right. All of us have denounced Trump's attempts to divide this country: the anti-Latino rhetoric the racist rhetoric he anti-Muslim rhetoric. But where I disagree with you Governor O'Malley is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires... ... who control economic and political life of this country. Nothing real will get happened. Unless we have a political revolution. Where millions of people finally stand up. Is that your strategy... Well the first difference is I don't take money from big banks. I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. What I would do... What I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America it is very clear to me what you have to do.You've got to bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and you've got to break up these huge financial institutions. They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today the old Republican trust buster what he would say is these guys are too powerful. Break them up. I believe that's what the American people to want see. That's my view. OK. First of all... Set the record right. In 2006 when I ran for the Senate Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me 2008 I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012 I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected. He and I are friends. We've worked together on many issues. We have some differences of opinion. But here is the issue Secretary touched on it can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals? So it's easy to say well I'm going to do this and do that but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street.I am very proud I do not have a super PAC. I do not want Wall Street's money. I'll rely on the middle class and working families... ... campaign contributions. Let me give you an example of how corrupt how corrupt this system is. Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion. Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury one on the Republicans one under Democrats. The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. Secretary Clinton and you're not the only one so I don't mean to just point the finger at you you've received over $600000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law not one of their executives is prosecuted while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence. If you want to... Anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs. They got the government off their backs. Turns out that they were crooks and they destroyed our economy. I think it's time to put the government back on their backs. ... Yeah... ... That's true. Good. You're right. I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure create 13 million jobs. We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands and not in some years pay a nickel in taxes. Yes I do. I plead guilty. I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college or university tuition free. And by the way I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well. How do I pay for it? I pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation. This country and the middle class bailed out Wall Street. Now it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class. In fact... ... we have documented unlike Secretary Clinton I have documented exactly how I would pay for our ambitious agenda. ... Here is the main two points... Yeah. ... I got it. What is correct and I'm disappointed that Secretary Clinton's campaign has made this criticism. It's a Republican criticism. Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare and she understands I believe that a medicare for all single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families. So what we have got to acknowledge and I hope the Secretary does is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums. So instead of paying $10000 dollars to Blue Cross or Blue Shield yes some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5000 dollars in healthcare costs. A little bit more in taxes do away with private health insurance premiums. It's a pretty good deal. Yeah. No it is not breaking my word. When you are it's one thing to say I'm raising taxes it's another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums. So if I save you $10000 in private health insurance and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total there are huge savings in what your family is spending. I was mayor for eight years I did that as well. I think we already are. Younger generation understands it instinctively. I was home in Burlington Vermont on Christmas Eve the temperature was 65 degrees. People in Vermont know what's going on. People who did ice fishing where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand what's going on.I'm on both the Environmental and Energy Committees. The debate is over. Climate change is real. It is already causing major problems. And if we do not act boldly and decisively a bad situation will become worse.It is amazing to me and I think we'll have agreement on this up here that we have a major party called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they don't even have the courage the decency to listen to the scientists. It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States somebody like Trump who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. Bottom line is we need to be bold and decisive we can create millions of jobs. We must for the sake of our kids and grandchildren transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.I've got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that. And as president I will fight to make that happen. I think what we've got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Understanding that Iran's behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism the anti-American rhetoric that we're hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable. On the other hand the fact that we've managed to reach an agreement something that I've very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war. And that I believe we're seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step. So if your question is do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? Yes.Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No I don't think we should. But I think the goal has go to be as we've done with Cuba to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world. As everybody you know this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud. I know President Obama's been getting a lot of criticism on this. I think he is doing the right thing. What the nightmare is which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq. To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president I will do everything in my power to avoid. We should we should learn we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS not with American troops in perpetual warfare. No. I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq which I vigorously opposed. Not only did I vote against it I helped lead the opposition. And what happened there is yes it's easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein but there wasn't the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs. And who rises up? Groups like ISIS. So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran and he said you know what I'm going to do my best to bring American troops home. And I supported what he did. Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.And one point I want to make here that is not made very often you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region countries like Saudi Arabia countries like Qatar. Qatar happens to be the largest wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it. Let me just... OK. Let me suggest... Where Secretary Clinton and I think I agree with most of what she said. But where I think we do have an honest disagreement is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria where it's hard to know who's fighting who and if you give arms to this guy it may end up in ISIS' hand the next day. We all know that. And we all know no argument the secretary is absolutely right Assad is a butcher of his own people man using chemical weapons against his own people. This is beyond disgusting.But I think in terms of our priorities in the region our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS. Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad through some political settlement working with Iran working with Russia.But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS including Russia including Iran including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority. OK. I just wanted to add in the previous question I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O'Malley mentioned. But it is not only the government that we have to worry about it is private corporations. You would all be amazed or maybe not about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access the products that you buy where you are this very moment.And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology. So yes we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information... Right. What we have got to do there is among other things as I was just saying have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is in fact discovered. But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people. Can I get 50 seconds? Can I get a can I just get a very brief response? Very brief. OK. One and I agree with what the secretary said and what Governor O'Malley said. But here's an issue that we also should talk about. We have a $600 billion military budget. It is a budget larger than the next eight countries'. Unfortunately much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union. Very little of that budget less than 10 percent actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism. We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department. Great ideas Governor O'Malley Secretary Clinton but here's the truth. If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees it ain't going to accomplish very much. So here's a promise that I make and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is Goldman Sachs paying a $5 billion fine gives this country in recent history a Republican secretary of treasury a Democratic secretary of treasury.Here's a promise. If elected president Goldman Sachs is not going to have bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration. I was asked a question. You know one of the things Andrea and I that question annoys me. I cannot walk down the street Secretary Clinton knows this without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton want to get me on the front pages of the paper I'd make some vicious attack. I have avoided doing that. Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign. I was asked a question. Well then if I don't answer it then there's another front page so it's yes. And I mean this seriously. You know that. We've been through this. Yes his behavior was deplorable. Have I ever once said a word about that issue? No I have not. I'm going to debate Secretary Clinton Governor O'Malley on the issues facing the American people not Bill Clinton's personal behavior. Well Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right is demanded the resignation of governor. A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power. Now we are a great nation and we've heard a lot of great ideas here tonight. Let's be honest and let's be truthful. Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.We've got to get rid of Super PACs we've got to get rid of Citizens' United and what we've got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process. To say loudly and clearly"" that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors."""
2016-01-17 00:00:00,brownlee, Hi my name Marques Brownlee and I've been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years. I think America's future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right. Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data but the government wants a back door into that information.So do you think it's possible to find common ground? And where do you stand on privacy versus security?
2016-01-17 00:00:00,clinton," Well good evening. And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow. You know I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King. I was a teenager. And his moral clarity the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service. I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.And that is our fight still. We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone including those who have been left out and left behind. We have to keep our communities and our country safe. We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.I understand that this is the hardest job in the world. I'm prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States. I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing infrastructure clean and renewable energy raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing finally equal pay for women's work. I would also... ...I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn't take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.And third I would be working in every way that I knew to bring our country together. We do have too much division too much mean- spiritedness. There's a lot we have to do on immigration reform on voting rights on campaign finance reform but we need to do it together. That's how we'll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve. Yes look I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders' own record that he has voted with the NRA with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said ""was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. "" He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. Let's not forget what this is about 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. That's 33000 people a year.One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. Now I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed. Well sadly it's reality and it has been heartbreaking and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott as you said who have been killed by police officers. Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And that requires a very clear agenda for retraining police officers looking at ways to end racial profiling finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison. That's the statistic. I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men and very often the black men are arrested convicted and incarcerated ... ...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.So we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore. Well Lester you're right. Everywhere I go to campaign I'm meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned. And I've met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren. So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that number one does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money about a billion dollars a year to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.The policing needs to change. Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it. So should firefighters and others.We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead move it to where it belongs as a health issue. And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts into treatment and recovery. So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now... ... a growing epidemic. Well Andrea I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I have worked on this for a long time people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the '90s and I didn't quit until we got the children's health insurance program that ensures eight million kids. And I certainly respect Senator Sanders' intentions but when you're talking about health care the details really matter. And therefore we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people's health care?He didn't like that his campaign didn't like it either. And tonight he's come out with a new health care plan. And again we need to get into the details. But here's what I believe the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.We finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it and I don't to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it. But Senator Sanders if I can... You know I have to say I'm not sure whether we're talking about the plan you just introduced tonight or we're talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress. But the fact is we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama of the Democratic Party and of our country. And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance. We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance. We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men. And we have seen young people up to the age of 26 being able to stay on their parent's policy. Now there are things we can do to improve it but to tear it up and start over again pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate I think is the wrong direction. And that's exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act what Governor O'Malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system. But with all due respect to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back. The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act and thank goodness President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people. Well as someone who as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry that spent you know... ...many many millions of dollars attacking me and probably will so again because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act I think it's important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today. I know how much money influences the political decision-making. That's why I'm for huge campaign finance reform. However we started a system that had private health insurance.And even during the Affordable Care Act debate there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option. In other words people could buy in to Medicare and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress we couldn't get the votes for that.So what I'm saying is really simple. This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Let's make it work.Let's take the models that states are doing. We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years. Now we've got to get individual costs down. That's what I'm planning to do. Well I think it's an important point the president made in his State of the Union. And here's what I would say. I will go anywhere to meet with anyone at any time to find common ground. That's what I did as a first lady when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Children's Health Insurance Program when I worked with Tom DeLay one of the most partisan of Republicans to reform the adoption and foster care system.What I did working in the Senate where I crossed the aisle often working even with the senator from South Carolina Lindsey Graham to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.And it's what I did as Secretary of State on numerous occasions and most particularly rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States.So I know it's hard but I also know you've got to work at it every single day. I look out here I see a lot of my friends from the Congress. And I know that they work at it every single day.Because maybe you can't only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party but who knows. If you're successful there maybe you can build even more. That's what I would do. Well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube that's quite an accomplishment. Look this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people. I've laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing. So making community college free making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault; on voting rights on women's rights on gay rights on civil rights on workers rights.And I know how much young people value their independence their autonomy and their rights. So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how we're going to encourage even more American's to vote because it absolutely clear to me... That turning over our White House to the Republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people. Look I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and I'm going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when I'm the Democratic nominee. Well there's no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail. We agree on that. But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don't just affect me I can take that but he's criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak disappointing. He even in 2011 publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama. Now I personally believe that President Obama's work to push through the Dodd-Frank... The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we've had since the 1930s. So I'm going to defend Dodd-Frank and I'm going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street taking on the financial industry and getting results. You know I think since since Senator Standers followed up on this... Your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011. But look I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher more effective and more comprehensive. It builds on the Dodd-Frank yes it is. It builds on the Dodd-Frank regulatory scheme... ... but it goes much further because... ... both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks. Lehman Brothers AIG the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession I go after them. And I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now and Karl Rove who started running an ad against me right now funded by money from the financial services sector sure thing I'm the one they don't want to be up against. Yes well first of all first of all Paul Krugman Barney Frank others have all endorsed my plan. Secondly we have Dodd-Frank. It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose... That pose a risk to the financial sector. I want to go further and add to that. And you know Governor you have raised money on Wall Street. You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governor's Association... And you were... Yes well the point is that if we're going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points we should know what's in Dodd-Frank and what's in Dodd-Frank already gives the president the authority... ...with his regulators to make those decisions. Well the last point on this is Senator Sanders you're the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000 to take the cops off the street to use Governor O'Malley's phrase to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives which were one of the main cause of the collapse in '08. So there's plenty... There's plenty of problems that we all have to face together. And the final thing I would say we're at least having a vigorous debate about reining in Wall Street... ... The Republicans want to give them more power and repeal Dodd-Frank. That's what we need to stop... Well I have actually documented every way that I'm going to pay for what I'm doing because I think the American public deserves to know. And you can go to my website and actually see that. But there are serious questions about how we're going to pay for what we want to see our country do. And I'm the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I want to raise incomes not taxes and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition for child care for paid family leave. To help us bring down student debt we're going to refinance that student debt saving kids thousands of dollars.Yeah and that will also come out of the some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry... But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything I've proposed... And let me... Well I'm very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement. And so they have been so far following their requirements under the agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them. We've had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization. And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement. And then we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria Yemen Iraq and elsewhere. Absolutely not. I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we're doing supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space. So I'm very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond. Look I think that the president's decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome. We were able to get the chemical weapons out. I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assad's forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria but it could very well have affected the surrounding states Jordan Israel Lebanon Turkey. So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal but... Well but but... I think as commander in chief you've got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make. I know a little bit about this having spent many hours in the situation room advising President Obama. And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region. If there is any blame to be spread around it starts with the prime minister of Iraq who sectarianized his military setting Shia against Sunni.It is amplified by Assad who has waged one of the bloodiest most terrible attacks on his own people: 250000-plus dead millions fleeing. Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately by terrorist groups including ISIS.So I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region. We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know one of the criticisms I've had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that you know Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria... ... and go after ISIS which I don't think would be a good idea. But overall a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence but we can... Well it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia. We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia. We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments. So look in diplomacy you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isn't some way you can advance your security and your values.When Putin came back in the fall of 2011 it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom and he cracked down. And in fact accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him. Well my relationship with him it's it's interesting. It's one I think of respect. We've had some very tough dealings with one another. And I know that he's someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because like many bullies he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner but we've got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East. Oh we're breaking? OK. Well I wanted to say and I'll do it quickly I was very pleased that leaders of President Obama's administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do consistent with privacy and security. We need better intelligence cooperation we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world. And then we've got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.And it is not only shameful it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you're hearing from the Republican side.We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves and working with Muslim Americans. That is not what I've heard. Let me leave it at that. Well it'll start at the kitchen table we'll see how it goes from there. And I... ...I'm going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husband's leadership and the '90s especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history you bet. I'm going to ask for his ideas I'm going ask for his advice and I'm going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we've got because I do believe as he said everything that's wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.We just have to do more of it and we have to reach out especially into poor communities and communities of color to give more people their own chance to get ahead. Well Lester I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what's happening in Flint Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged. We've had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn't really care. He had request for help and he had basically stone walled. I'll tell you what if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it there would've been action.So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help. I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V. show and I said ""it was outrageous that the governor hadn't acted and within two hours he had."" I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday."
2016-01-17 00:00:00,announcer, Hello from MinuteEarth. Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit. But we know that burning these fuels releases heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events like South Carolina's devastating flooding last year.Fighting human-caused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the world's energy supply to alternative sources.Some countries have acted decisively to make this transition. But here at home we still get a whooping 82 percent of our energy from coal oil and natural gas.In the U.S. political gridlock pressure from industry lobbyists and insufficient R&amp;D; have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.
2016-01-17 00:00:00,holt," Good evening and welcome to the NBC News Youtube Democratic candidate's debate.

So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office my top three priorities will be fill in the blank.Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton same question my first 100 days in office my top three priorities will be. Governor O'Malley same question. Thank you. You've all... All right governor thank you. We've all laid out large visions and we're going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Let's start with one of them the issue of guns.Senator Sanders last week Secretary Clinton called you quote ""a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby."" Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers can you tell us why? Senator but you didn't answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers. So can you... Secretary Clinton would you like to respond to Senator Sanders. All right Governor O'Malley you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing ""you want to take my guns. What would you say to them? Alright Governor thank you. Secretary Clinton this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year. Of course as you mentioned the church shootings. We won't forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception or in your view is it reality? You time is up. Senator Sanders my next question is... ... It's actually actually my next question is to you... Senator Sanders... Senator. Senator Sanders... ... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton not you. He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision. In fact our polling shows she's beating you more than two to one among minority voters. How can you be the nominee if you don't have that support? Governor I'm going to come to you in a second. Google searches for the words ""Black Lives Matter"" surpassed ""civil rights movement"". And here in South Carolina ""black lives matter"" was the number one trending political issue.HOLT: Governor O'Malley you've campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland and before that the mayor of Baltimore. Last year of course Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.And right from the start of your campaign you've been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear? All right. Let's talk... Let's talk more about policing and the criminal justice system. Senator Sanders a few times tonight we're going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube starting with Franchesca Ramsey who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos. Let's watch. Senator Sanders. Would you like me to read it back to you? Prosecutors ""I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities. Most recently we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?"" Secretary Clinton this question is for you. Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic spanning race and class hitting small towns and cities alike. It has become a major issue in this race. In a lot of places where you've been campaigning despite an estimated trillion dollars spent many say the war on drugs has failed. So what would you do? And that's time. Senator... Senator Sanders would you like to respond? That's... ... time. We're going to get into all that coming up. But we're going to take a break and we need to take a break... ... and when we come back the anger brewing in America. Welcome back to Charleston. Let's turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement that would be health care. Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.Let's turn to my colleague Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning. And that's time. We're gonna take a turn now. Secretary Clinton in his final State of the Union address President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together. If President Obama couldn't do it how will you? That's time. Senator Sanders response. That's time. But let me continue with the... Senator Sanders let me continue you call yourself a Democratic socialist... And throughout your career in politics you've been critical of the Democratic party you've been saying in a book you wrote quote ""There wasn't a hell of a big difference between the the two major parties."" How would you will a general election... How will you win a general election labeling yourself a democratic socialist? Yes but senator you can... And that is right. Secretary Clinton our next question is for you. Here's another quantitative problem. And we're going to get into that coming up. But Secretary Clinton here's a question from YouTube. It's from a young video blogger who has over 5 million subscribers. He has a question about the importance of younger voters. Secretary Clinton. That's time... A quick follow up a thirty second follow up. Why is Senator Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes? We're going to take... We're going to take a break. When we come back; big banks big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American Economy. We'll be right back. Welcome back from Charleston. Let's turn now to the economy. Senator Sanders you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. ""One says it's OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do. My plan break up the big banks close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.""What do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do? Secretary Clinton help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here. Senator Sanders your response. That's time. Governor O'Malley... I have a question for you... Thirty-second response. Governor O'Malley. Secretary Clinton 30-second response. That's time. Andrea. ... Senator... We have got a lot to ground to cover here. Many Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change including the team of scientists from Youtube's MinuteEarth channel.Here's their take. Senator Sanders Americans love their SUVs which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted. How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior? Governor O'Malley 30 seconds. That's time. We're going to take a break. When we return the late-breaking developments regarding Iran. The threat of ISIS now more real than ever on U.S. soil. Americans in fear and hearing few good answers. We'll be right back. Charleston Andrea Mitchell has questions now starting with Iran. Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago. Secretary Clinton you famously handed Russia's foreign minister a reset button in 2009. Since then Russia has annexed Crimea fomented a war in Ukraine provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations as we just did discuss to support Assad in Syria. As president would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button? What's your relationship with him? We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans. That brings us to YouTube and this question. So Governor O'Malley. That's time. You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there but we've been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists from Chattanooga to San Bernardino the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia. How are you going to fight the lone wolves here Senator Sanders? That's a question to Senator Sanders. I wasn't clear I apologize. But in terms of lone wolves the threat how would you do it? We have to go to a we have to go to a break and when we come back we're going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about. And welcome back to Charleston. As we were going to a break Secretary Clinton I cut you off. I'll give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves. Secretary Clinton. And Andrea has a follow-up. All right that's time and and we do... ...we do have to move on. Secretary Clinton this is the first time... Thirty 30 30 seconds Senator. All right. Secretary Clinton... ...this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president. You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues but be specific if you can. Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics or will he have a real policy role? Senator sanders a 30 second response sir. We will take a break. We'll continue from Charleston right after this. Welcome back everybody. Finally before we go tonight we set out here to understand points of differences between you. We believe we've learned a lot here but before we leave is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you haven't gotten a chance to say. And we'll start with Governor O'Malley. Didn't see that coming did you? Sixty seconds we'd appreciate it. And that's time. Secretary Clinton? And that's time. Thank you. Senator Sanders?"
2016-01-17 00:00:00,moderators, Lester Holt (NBC News) Andrea Mitchell (NBC News)
2016-01-17 00:00:00,franchesca ramsey, Hey I'm Franchesca Ramsey. I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities. For example last month the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice weren't indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?
2016-01-17 00:00:00,o'malley," Thank you. My name is Martin O'Malley I was born the year Dr. King delivered his ""I Have A Dream"" speech. And I want to thank the people of South Carolina not only for hosting our debate here tonight but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.You taught us in fact in keeping with Dr. King's teaching that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.Eight years ago you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression. And that's what he's done. Our country's doing better we're creating jobs again.But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law and we have urgent work to do and the voices of anger and fear and division that we've heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.We need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.That's why I'm running for president. I need your help I ask for your vote and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.Thank you. Thank you. First of all I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans rather than down. Equal pay for equal work making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour however we can wherever we can. Secondly I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way. Finally I'm sorry that was second Lester. And third and finally we need a new agenda for America's cities. We have not had a new agenda for America's cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people that will invest in CBVG transportation infrastructure and transit options and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people. This is what I would say Lester look see I've listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. They've both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue. I'm the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns' Hopkins Hospital he was getting a birthday haircut the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy's head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.And I remember visiting him it did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. In his diapers with tubes running in and out of his head same age as my little boy.So after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons universal background checks and you know what? We did not interrupt a single person's hunting season.I've never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer. And so... ...we're able to actually do these things. Lester I Yes let's talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999 Lester it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young poor black men every single year. And that's why I ran because yes black lives matter. And we did a number of things. We weren't able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. The truth of the matter is we created a civilian review board. And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I've put forward.We created a civilian review board gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy use of excessive force lethal force. I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work... ... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system. Lester just ten seconds. Just 10 seconds. All of the things... I have to talk about something that's actually working in our state. Andrea Andrea Andrea. Instead of Andrea I think instead of attacking one another on health care we should be talking about the things that are actually working. In our state we have moved to an all-payer system. With the Affordable Care Act we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals that driver of cost at the center away from fee-for- service.And actually to pay we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital. How well they keep their patients. That's the future. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act do the things that work and reduce costs and increase access. Great question. Yes but senator you never came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. In fact neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. We can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger Democratic party but Lester the question you answered it's no laughing matter.The most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across Iowa and talk with my neighbors is how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country? This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.All my life I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds and that's what we need now in a new leader. We cannot keep talking past each other declaring all Republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires or it's all against American Muslims all against immigrants.Look as Frederick Douglas said we are one our cause is one and we must help each other if we are going to succeed. I agree with that. I agree. That's not true. It's just not true. Oh come on. Yes thank you. Yes Lester what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true. What I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street. I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic. Look if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist he's just going to keep robbing banks again. The same thing is true with people in suits.Secretary Clinton I have a tremendous amount of respect for you but for you to say there's no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.In prior debates I've heard you even bring up I mean now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.In an earlier debate I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it. The truth of the matter is Secretary Clinton you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.And the fact of the matter is the people of America deserve to have a president that's on their side protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And we're just as vulnerable today. And we have never used it. Yes but I haven't gotten a penny this year... ... so somebody please go on to martinomalley.com... . Go on to martinomalley.com send me your checks. They're not giving me zero. Say it.  Andrea... ... The only person on this stage who has... Senator I'm the only person on this stage that's actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years. OK. So that was eight years. Yes. And Senator but I actually did it during a budget down time I mean during a recession. And Andrea the I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland but we invested more in infrastructure more in transportation. We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row and went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.The things that we need to do in our country like debt-free college in the next five years like making universal like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.And that is the wealthy among us those making more than a million dollars feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.And if we tax earnings from investments on money namely capital gains at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better. Thank you. Lester on this stage tonight this Democratic stage where we actually believe in science. I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050. It can be done. With solar with wind with new technologies with green buildings this can happen but in all President Obama made us more energy independent but in all of the above strategy didn't land us on the moon we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids. Andrea... Thank you. Andrea governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.We need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special special ops advisers we need do need to provide the technical support but over the long-term we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.And I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate we don't use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato and macho sending other kids kids into combat they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington Iowa said to me ""Governor when you're with your colleagues please don't refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground."" Now we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past. But in all of that senator and secretary I think we're leaving out something very important here. And that is that we still don't have the human intelligence: overt in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things. We are walking through this region Andrea without the human intelligence that we need. And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror. Thank you. I believe whether it's a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant whether they want to come through the back door or your front door. And I also agree Lester with Benjamin Franklin who said no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.So we're a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms. And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.I also want to the say that while we've made some progress on the Patriot Act I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there. We need a public advocate. We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age. Yes Lester year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ... Can I get 30 seconds too? And Andrea Andrea Andrea... Andrea when can I get my 30 seconds? Andrea I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness. Ever since the attacks of September 11th 30 seconds. Ever since the attacks of September 11th my colleagues Democratic and Republican mayors Democratic and Republican governors made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.Here in the homeland unlike combating ISIL abroad we're almost like it's your body's immune system. It's able to protect your body against bad bugs not necessarily because it outnumbers them but it's better connected the fusion centers the biosurveillance systems better prepared first responders.But there's another front in this battle and it is this. That's the political front and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith he can start with me and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims. That can do more damage to our democracy than any... Yes but we're going to have to get 20 minutes to do it so. I believe there are many issues. I have 60 seconds for this? There are so many issues that we haven't been able to discuss here. We have not fully discussed immigration reform and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation's now maintaining. We haven't discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico our fellow Americans are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over. We haven't discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador.I guess the bottom line is this look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us. Our belief in the dignity of every person our belief in our own common good. There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.We're on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity. Thanks a lot."
2016-01-17 00:00:00,mitchell," Thank you Lester. Secretary Clinton Senator Sanders favors what he calls ""Medicare for all."" Now you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.Secretary Clinton is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare? Senator Sanders? Governor Governor Sanders... Senator Sanders let me ask you this though... ... you've talked about Medicare for all... .. and tonight you've released a very detailed plan just two... ... well two hours before the debate you did. But let me ask you about Vermont. Because in Vermont you tried in the state of Vermont and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea of of Medicare for all single-payer because they concluded it would require major tax increases... ... and by some estimates it would double the budget. If you couldn't sell it in Vermont Senator... ... how can you sell it to the country? Senator Sanders Senator Sanders you've talked a lot about things you want to do. You want free education for everyone you want the Federal Minimum Wage raised to $15 an hour. You want to expand Social Security... ... benefits. You've been specific about what you want but let's talk about how to pay for all this. You now said that you would raise taxes today two hours or so ago you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan. You haven't been specific about how to pay for the other things... ... Will you tell us tonight? ... OK... ... Secretary Clinton you mentioned earlier Secretary Clinton do you want to respond? OK we're out of time. Senator Sanders Senator Sanders... ... Senator Sanders let me ask you a question about taxes. The most googled political issue... In the last month was taxes. Now in your healthcare plan the plan you released tonight you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also. Is that correct? Senator Senator let me just follow up on that. On Meet the Press on December 20th you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave. And having said that now you say you're going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well. Is that breaking your word? Thank you Lester. Senator Sanders the nuclear deal is now enforced. Iran is getting it's billions of dollars several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home. The president said today ""it's a good day. It's a good day for diplomacy. It's a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran."" Your response Secretary Clinton? You mentioned Syria. Let me ask you about Syria all of you. Let's turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there. Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role? Let me start with you Secretary Clinton. Senator Sanders ground forces yes or no? Governor O'Malley? Governor O'Malley. I have a question. I have a question for Senator Sanders. Did the policies of the Obama administration in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow? Secretary Clinton I want to talk to you about red lines because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama's decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the president's credibility. Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it? But should he should he have stuck to his... ... line? Did it hurt U.S. credibility? Your time is up. Senator.... You're out of time. Senator Sanders. Your time is us. Lester. Just a just a quick follow-up though Secretary Clinton. Just a moment Governor. But but Secretary Clinton you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley they were flatly turned down. They got nowhere. Senator Sanders let me ask you a question. You called Bill Clinton's past transgressions quote ""totally totally totally disgraceful and unacceptable."" Senator do you regret saying that? : You didn't have to answer it that way though. Why did you? ...too long."
2016-01-17 00:00:00,franta, Hi I'm Connor Franta I'm 23 and my audience is around the same age. Getting my generation to vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate. Now I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers but what I want to know is how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?
2015-12-15 00:00:00,trump," Thank you. I began this journey six months ago. My total focus was on building up our military building up our strength building up our borders making sure that China Japan Mexico both at the border and in trade no longer takes advantage of our country.Certainly would never have made that horrible disgusting absolutely incompetent deal with Iran where they get $150 billion. They're a terrorist nation. But I began it talking about other things.And those things are things that I'm very good at and maybe that's why I'm center stage. People saw it. People liked it. People respected it.A month ago things changed. Radical Islamic terrorism came into effect even more so than it has been in the past. People like what I say. People respect what I say. And we've opened up a very big discussion that needed to be opened up.Thank you very much. We are not talking about isolation. We're talking about security. We're not talking about religion. We're talking about security. Our country is out of control. People are pouring across the southern border. I will build a wall. It will be a great wall. People will not come in unless they come in legally. Drugs will not pour through that wall. As far as other people like in the migration where they're going tens of thousands of people having cell phones with ISIS flags on them? I don't think so Wolf. They're not coming to this country. And if I'm president and if Obama has brought some to this country they are leaving. They're going. They're gone. Jeb doesn't really believe I'm unhinged. He said that very simply because he has failed in this campaign. It's been a total disaster. Nobody cares. And frankly I'm the most solid person up here. I built a tremendous company and all I want to do is make America great again. I don't want our country to be taken away from us and that's what's happening. The policies that we've suffered under other presidents have been a disaster for our country. We want to make America great again. And Jeb in all fairness he doesn't believe that. Well look this is so easy to answer. ISIS is recruiting through the Internet. ISIS is using the Internet better than we are using the Internet and it was our idea. What I wanted to do is I wanted to get our brilliant people from Silicon Valley and other places and figure out a way that ISIS cannot do what they're doing. You talk freedom of speech. You talk freedom of anything you want. I don't want them using our Internet to take our young impressionable youth and watching the media talking about how they're masterminds these are masterminds. They shouldn't be using the word ""mastermind."" These are thugs. These are terrible people in ISIS not masterminds. And we have to change it from every standpoint. But we should be using our brilliant people our most brilliant minds to figure a way that ISIS cannot use the Internet. And then on second we should be able to penetrate the Internet and find out exactly where ISIS is and everything about ISIS. And we can do that if we use our good people. I would certainly be open to closing areas where we are at war with somebody. I sure as hell don't want to let people that want to kill us and kill our nation use our Internet. Yes sir I am. We have to be much tougher. We have to be much stronger than we've been. We have people that know what is going on. You take a look at just the attack in California the other day. There were numerous people including the mother that knew what was going on. They saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the floor. They saw ammunition all over the place. They knew exactly what was going on.When you had the World Trade Center go people were put into planes that were friends family girlfriends and they were put into planes and they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia.They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television. I would be very very firm with families. Frankly that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives but they do care believe it or not about their families' lives. Look the problem is we need toughness. Honestly I think Jeb is a very nice person. He's a very nice person. But we need tough people. We need toughness. We need intelligence and we need tough. Jeb said when they come across the southern border they come as an act of love. Am I talking or are you talking Jeb? You can go back. You're not talking. You interrupted me. Are you going to apologize Jeb? No. Am I allowed to finish? Excuse me am I allowed to finish? So... ... again... I know you're trying to build up your energy Jeb but it's not working very well. Look look look. We need a toughness. We need strength. We're not respected you know as a nation anymore. We don't have that level of respect that we need. And if we don't get it back fast we're just going to go weaker weaker and just disintegrate. We can't allow that to happen. We need strength. We don't have it. When Jeb comes out and he talks about the border and I saw it and I was witness to it and so was everyone else and I was standing there ""they come across as an act of love"" he's saying the same thing right now with radical Islam.And we can't have that in our country. It just won't work. We need strength. With Jeb's attitude we will never be great again that I can tell you. We will never be great again. So they can kill us but we can't kill them? That's what you're saying. And as far as the Internet is concerned we're not talking about closing the Internet. I'm talking about parts of Syria parts of Iraq where ISIS is spotting it. Now you could close it. What I like even better than that is getting our smartest and getting our best to infiltrate their Internet so that we know exactly where they're going exactly where they're going to be. I like that better. But we have to who would be I just can't imagine somebody booing. These are people that want to kill us folks and you're you're objecting to us infiltrating their conversations? I don't think so. I don't think so. Thank you. I began this journey six months ago. My total focus was on building up our military building up our strength building up our borders making sure that China Japan Mexico both at the border and in trade no longer takes advantage of our country.Certainly would never have made that horrible disgusting absolutely incompetent deal with Iran where they get $150 billion. They're a terrorist nation. But I began it talking about other things.And those things are things that I'm very good at and maybe that's why I'm center stage. People saw it. People liked it. People respected it.A month ago things changed. Radical Islamic terrorism came into effect even more so than it has been in the past. People like what I say. People respect what I say. And we've opened up a very big discussion that needed to be opened up.Thank you very much. We are not talking about isolation. We're talking about security. We're not talking about religion. We're talking about security. Our country is out of control. People are pouring across the southern border. I will build a wall. It will be a great wall. People will not come in unless they come in legally. Drugs will not pour through that wall. As far as other people like in the migration where they're going tens of thousands of people having cell phones with ISIS flags on them? I don't think so Wolf. They're not coming to this country. And if I'm president and if Obama has brought some to this country they are leaving. They're going. They're gone. Jeb doesn't really believe I'm unhinged. He said that very simply because he has failed in this campaign. It's been a total disaster. Nobody cares. And frankly I'm the most solid person up here. I built a tremendous company and all I want to do is make America great again. I don't want our country to be taken away from us and that's what's happening. The policies that we've suffered under other presidents have been a disaster for our country. We want to make America great again. And Jeb in all fairness he doesn't believe that. Well look this is so easy to answer. ISIS is recruiting through the Internet. ISIS is using the Internet better than we are using the Internet and it was our idea. What I wanted to do is I wanted to get our brilliant people from Silicon Valley and other places and figure out a way that ISIS cannot do what they're doing. You talk freedom of speech. You talk freedom of anything you want. I don't want them using our Internet to take our young impressionable youth and watching the media talking about how they're masterminds these are masterminds. They shouldn't be using the word ""mastermind."" These are thugs. These are terrible people in ISIS not masterminds. And we have to change it from every standpoint. But we should be using our brilliant people our most brilliant minds to figure a way that ISIS cannot use the Internet. And then on second we should be able to penetrate the Internet and find out exactly where ISIS is and everything about ISIS. And we can do that if we use our good people. I would certainly be open to closing areas where we are at war with somebody. I sure as hell don't want to let people that want to kill us and kill our nation use our Internet. Yes sir I am. We have to be much tougher. We have to be much stronger than we've been. We have people that know what is going on. You take a look at just the attack in California the other day. There were numerous people including the mother that knew what was going on. They saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the floor. They saw ammunition all over the place. They knew exactly what was going on.When you had the World Trade Center go people were put into planes that were friends family girlfriends and they were put into planes and they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia.They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television. I would be very very firm with families. Frankly that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives but they do care believe it or not about their families' lives. Look the problem is we need toughness. Honestly I think Jeb is a very nice person. He's a very nice person. But we need tough people. We need toughness. We need intelligence and we need tough. Jeb said when they come across the southern border they come as an act of love. Am I talking or are you talking Jeb? You can go back. You're not talking. You interrupted me. Are you going to apologize Jeb? No. Am I allowed to finish? Excuse me am I allowed to finish? So... ... again... I know you're trying to build up your energy Jeb but it's not working very well. Look look look. We need a toughness. We need strength. We're not respected you know as a nation anymore. We don't have that level of respect that we need. And if we don't get it back fast we're just going to go weaker weaker and just disintegrate. We can't allow that to happen. We need strength. We don't have it. When Jeb comes out and he talks about the border and I saw it and I was witness to it and so was everyone else and I was standing there ""they come across as an act of love"" he's saying the same thing right now with radical Islam.And we can't have that in our country. It just won't work. We need strength. With Jeb's attitude we will never be great again that I can tell you. We will never be great again. So they can kill us but we can't kill them? That's what you're saying. And as far as the Internet is concerned we're not talking about closing the Internet. I'm talking about parts of Syria parts of Iraq where ISIS is spotting it. Now you could close it. What I like even better than that is getting our smartest and getting our best to infiltrate their Internet so that we know exactly where they're going exactly where they're going to be. I like that better. But we have to who would be I just can't imagine somebody booing. These are people that want to kill us folks and you're you're objecting to us infiltrating their conversations? I don't think so. I don't think so."
2015-12-15 00:00:00,christie, Thank you Wolf. America has been betrayed. We've been betrayed by the leadership that Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton have provided to this country over the last number of years. Think about just what's happened today. The second largest school district in America in Los Angeles closed based on a threat. Think about the effect that that's going to have on those children when they go back to school tomorrow wondering filled with anxiety to whether they're really going to be safe.Think about the mothers who will take those children tomorrow morning to the bus stop wondering whether their children will arrive back on that bus safe and sound. Think about the fathers of Los Angeles who tomorrow will head off to work and wonder about the safety of their wives and their children.What is Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton done to this country? That the most basic responsibility of an administration is to protect the safety and security of the American people. I will tell you this I'm a former federal prosecutor I've fought terrorists and won and when we get back in the White House we will fight terrorists and win again and America will be safe. Wolf unfortunately it's the new normal under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The fact is that if you listen to Hillary Clinton the other day what she said to the American people was as regards to ISIS my strategy would be just about the same as the president's. Just about the same as the president's? We have people across this country who are scared to death. Because I could tell you this as a former federal prosecutor if a center for the developmentally disabled in San Bernardino California is now a target for terrorists that means everywhere in America is a target for these terrorists.Now I spent seven years of my life in the immediate aftermath of September 11th doing this work working with the Patriot Act working with our law enforcement working with the surveillance community to make sure that we keep America safe.What we need to do Wolf is restore those tools that have been taken away by the president and others restore those tools to the NSA and to our entire surveillance and law enforcement community.We need a president who is going to understand what actionable intelligence looks like and act on it. And we need a president and a cabinet who understands that the first and most important priority of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of Americans.As someone who has done it I will make sure it gets done again. Listen I want to talk to the audience at home for a second. If your eyes are glazing over like mine this is what it's like to be on the floor of the United States Senate. I mean endless debates about how many angels on the head of a pin from people who've never had to make a consequential decision in an executive position. The fact is for seven years I had to make these decisions after 9/11 make a decision about how to proceed forward with an investigation or how to pull back whether you use certain actionable intelligence or whether not to. And yet they continue to debate about this bill and in the subcommittee and what nobody in America cares about that.What they care about is are we going to have a president who actually knows what they're doing to make these decisions? And for the seven years afterwards New Jersey was threatened like no other region in this country and what we did was we took action within the constitution to make sure that law enforcement had all the information they needed.We prosecuted two of the biggest terrorism cases in the world and stopped Fort Dix from being attacked by six American radicalized Muslims from a Mosque in New Jersey because we worked with the Muslim American community to get intelligence and we used the Patriot Act to get other intelligence to make sure we did those cases. This is the difference between actually been a federal prosecutor actually doing something and not just spending your life as one of hundred debating it.Let's talk about how we do this not about which bill which one these guys like more.

2015-12-15 00:00:00,josh jacob college student, I'm Josh Jacob from Georgia Tech. Recently Donald Trump mentioned we must kill the families of ISIS members. However this violates the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in international law. So my question is how would intentionally killing innocent civilians set us apart from ISIS?

2015-12-15 00:00:00,rubio, Thank you Wolf. It's really amazing to be back in Las Vegas. I spent six years as a child growing not far from where we stand tonight. I use to sit on the porch of our home and listen to my grandfather tell stories as he smoked one of three daily cigars.One of the things my grandfather instilled in me was that I was really blessed because I was a citizen of the greatest country in the history of our mankind. But there have always been people in American politics that wanted America to be more like the rest of the world. And In 2008 one of them was elected president of this country and the result has been a disaster.Today you have millions of Americans that feel left out and out of place in their own country struggling to live paycheck to paycheck called bigots because they hold on to traditional values.And around the world America's influence has declined while this president has destroyed our military our allies no longer trust us and our adversaries no longer respect us. And that is why this election is so important.That is why I'm running for president. And that's why I'm going to ask you for your vote tonight. If you elect me president we will have a president that believes America is the greatest country in the world and we will have a president that acts like it. Well I understand why they feel that way because this president hasn't kept us safe. The problem is we had an attack in San Bernardino. And we were paying attention to the most important issue we have faced in a decade since 9/11 and then all the talk was about this proposal which isn't going to happen. But this is what's important to do is we must deal frontally with this threat of radical Islamists especially from ISIS. This is the most sophisticated terror group that has ever threatened the world or the United States of America. They are actively recruiting Americans. The attacker in San Bernardino was an American citizen born and raised in this country. He was a health inspector; had a newborn child and left all that behind to kill 14 people.We also understand that this is a group that's growing in its governance of territory. It's not just Iraq and Syria. They are now a predominant group in Libya. They are beginning to pop up in Afghanistan. They are increasingly involved now in attacks in Yemen. They have Jordan in their sights.This group needs to be confronted with serious proposals. And this is a very significant threat we face. And the president has left us unsafe. He spoke the other night to the American people to reassure us. I wish he hadn't spoken at all. He made things worse. Because what he basically said was we are going to keep doing what we're doing now and what we are doing now is not working. He is and so are those that voted for it. There were some that voted for it because they wanted to keep it alive and they were afraid the whole program would expire. Here's the world we live in. This is a radical jihadist group that is increasingly sophisticated in its ability for example to radicalize American citizens in its inability to exploit loopholes in our legal immigration system in its ability to capture and hold territory in the Middle East as I outlined earlier in multiple countries.This is not just the most capable it is the most sophisticated terror threat we have ever faced. We are now at a time when we need more tools not less tools. And that took we lost the metadata program was a valuable tool that we no longer have at our disposal. Dana may I interject here? Let me be very careful when answering this because I don't think national television in front of 15 million people is the place to discuss classified information. So let me just be very clear. There is nothing that we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before. This bill did however take away a valuable tool that allowed the National Security Agency and other law and other intelligence agencies to quickly and rapidly access phone records and match them up with other phone records to see who terrorists have been calling. Because I promise you the next time there is attack on an attack on this country the first thing people are going to want to know is why didn't we know about it and why didn't we stop it? And the answer better not be because we didn't have access to records or information that would have allowed us to identify these killers before they attacked. I want to thank Rand for another 30 seconds because number one what he's pointing to is a bill last week that amendment that he voted for that only 10 people voted for. You know why? Because it's not focused on terrorists. It would have banned anyone from coming here. Someone from Taiwan would not have been able to come here as a tourist. Number two this program this metadata program is actually more strict than what a regular law enforcement agency has now. If a regular law enforcement agency wants your phone records all they have to do is issue a subpoena. But now the intelligence agency is not able to quickly gather records and look at them to see who these terrorists are calling. And the terrorists that attacked us in San Bernardino was an American citizen born and raised in this country. And I bet you we wish we would have had access to five years of his records so we could see who he was working with... Do I get another 30 seconds? He mentioned me. Well let me begin by saying that we have to understand who ISIS is. ISIS is a radical Sunni group. They cannot just be defeated through air strikes. Air strikes are a key component of defeating them but they must be defeated on the ground by a ground force. And that ground force must be primarily made up of Sunni Arabs themselves Sunni Arabs that reject them ideologically and confront them militarily. We will have to embed additional American special operators alongside them to help them with training to help them conduct special missions and to help improve the air strikes. The air strikes are important but we need to have an air force capable of it. And because of the budget cuts we are facing in this country we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air Force we have ever had. We have to reverse those cuts in addition to the cuts to our Navy and in addition to the cuts to our Army as well.And beyond that I would say we must win the information war against ISIS. Every war we have ever been involved in has had a propaganda informational aspect to it. ISIS is winning the propaganda war. They are recruiting people including Americans to join them with the promise that they are joining this great apocalyptic movement that is going to defeat the West. We have to show what life is really like in ISIS territory and we have to show them why ISIS is not invincible by going out and conducting these attacks and publicizing them to those who they recruit. That is accurate. Three times he voted against the Defense Authorization Act which is a bill that funds the troops. It also by the way funds the Iron Dome and other important programs. And I have to assume that if you vote against it in the Senate you would also veto it as president. He has also supported by the way a budget that is called the containment budget. And it is a budget that would radically reduce the amount of money we spend on our military. You can't carpet bomb ISIS if you don't have planes and bombs to attack them with. And if we continue those cuts that we're doing now not to mention additional cuts we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air Force this country has ever had and that leaves us less safe. Yes let me three points of distinction. The first is if you're an American citizen and you decide to join up with ISIS we're not going to read you your Miranda rights. You're going to be treated as an enemy combatant a member of an army attacking this country. Number two we do need our defense capabilities. It is a fact that the cuts we are facing today and the cuts that Senator Cruz would have supported would leave us with an even smaller Air Force and a smaller Navy than the one we are going to be left with.And the final point that I would make is Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's strategy is to lead from behind. It sounds like what he is outlining is not to lead at all. We cannot continue to outsource foreign policy. We must lead. We are the most powerful nation in the world. We need to begin to act like it again. Well they most certainly will have to be worked on to provide more than what they are doing now. There's no doubt about it. And there's one one major reason why they have not been willing to be a broader part of the coalition and that is they have lost complete trust and confidence in this president. This president cut a deal with their moral enemy the Shia in Iran. And this is the reason why they no longer trust this president and are willing to work alongside them. But they have as much invested in this as we do. In fact more so for it is the king of Saudi Arabia they want to behead first. It's the king of Jordan that they want to dethrone. It's the they want to go into Egypt the way they've already gone into Libya.And on another point that we need to talk about Assad is one of the main reasons why ISIS even exists to begin with. Assad is a puppet of Iran. And he has been so brutal toward the Sunni within Syria that he created the space that led to the people of Syria themselves to stand up and try to overthrow him. That led to the chaos which allowed ISIS to come in and take advantage of that situation and grow more powerful.And the fact that this president led from behind meant there were no alternative groups on the ground to be empowered leaving ISIS with the prime operating space they needed to become the force they have now become. Thank you Wolf. It's really amazing to be back in Las Vegas. I spent six years as a child growing not far from where we stand tonight.

I'd like to invite each candidate to introduce himself or herself to our audience. You'll have one minute.First to you Senator Paul. Thank you Senator. Governor Kasich? Governor Christie? Ms. Fiorina? Governor Bush? Senator Rubio? Senator Cruz. Dr. Carson. Mr. Trump. Thank you. Since you last debated Americans have witnessed terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. The FBI director says the country now faces the greatest terror threat since 9/11. You all have different approaches to keeping the country safe. And that will be the focus of tonight's debate.Mr. Trump as you mentioned in your opening statement part of your strategy is to focus in on America's borders. To keep the country safe you say you want to temporarily ban non-American Muslims from coming to the United States; ban refugees fleeing ISIS from coming here; deport 11 million people; and wall off America's southern border. Is the best way to make America great again to isolate it from much of the rest of the world? Governor Bush you called Mr. Trump ""unhinged"" when he proposed banning non-American Muslims from the United States. Why is that unhinged? Mr. Trump? Senator Rubio I'm going to go to Senator Rubio and get his thoughts. You have said banning Muslims is unconstitutional. But according to a recent ABC News-Washington Post poll a majority of Republicans support Mr. Trump's idea. Why are they wrong? Hugh Hewitt you have a question. Governor Christie Americans are clearly more afraid today than at any time since 9/11. As you mentioned in your opening statement today in Los Angeles 650 schoolchildren didn't go to 650000 schoolchildren didn't go to school because of an e-mail threat this two weeks after an attack killed 14 people in San Bernardino. Is this the new normal? And if so what steps would you take as president of the United States to ensure that fear does not paralyze America? Thank you. Governor Kasich one of the killers in San Bernardino was an American who was not on anyone's watch list. How are you going to find that radicalized person and stop another such attack? Thank you. Dana Bash you have the next question. Thank you. Dr. Carson you're in favor of monitoring mosques and schools where there is anti-America sentiment what do you consider anti- America? Dr. Carson who was right in that little debate that we just heard between Senator Rubio and Senator Paul? Hold on a sec we have a lot more to come and everybody's going to have their full opportunity. Governor Bush six days after 9/11 your brother visited a mosque and said quote ""Islam is peace."" The conversation tonight is about banning Muslims and surveillance of mosques are President Bush's words still relevant in today's Republican party? Ms. Fiorina as you pointed out you were a CEO in Silicon Valley on 9/11. Companies there they say they won't help the FBI now crack encrypted communication from ISIS should they be forced to. But my question was: Should these Silicon Valley companies be forced to cooperate with the FBI? Mr. Trump you recently suggested closing that Internet up those were your words as a way to stop ISIS from recruiting online. Are you referring to closing down actual portions of the Internet? Some say that would put the U.S. in line with China and North Korea. Let me follow up Mr. Trump. So are you open to closing parts of the Internet? Thank you. Governor Kasich is shutting down any part of the Internet a good idea? Thank you Governor. The fight against radical Islamic terrorists and ISIS has been called the war of our time. So let's talk about how each of you as commander in chief would fight this war and win it.Senator Cruz you have said you would quote ""carpet bomb ISIS into oblivion"" testing whether quote ""sand can glow in the dark."" Does that mean leveling the ISIS capital of Raqqa in Syria where there are hundreds of thousands of civilians? Thank you. To be clear Senator Cruz would you carpet bomb Raqqa the ISIS capital where there are a lot of civilians yes or no? Thank you. Thank you Senator. Senator Rubio you've been critical of Senator Cruz's strategy. You say his voting record doesn't match his rhetoric. Why? Because I asked the question Senator because you said this. You said he referring to Senator Cruz voted against the Defense Authorization Act every year that it came up and I assume that if he voted against it he would veto it as president. That's the bill that funds our troops. Senator Cruz? Senator Rubio. We are going to have much more on this... We're going to have much more on this. But I want to move now back to Mr. Trump. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. We have a lot... We have a lot to discuss. I want to move to Mr. Trump right now. We have a question on this war against ISIS and how you would fight and win this war. Here's the question from Facebook. Listen to this. Mr. Trump. Governor Bush. Governor Bush. Mr. Trump. Just one at a time go ahead... Go ahead Mr. Trump. Governor Bush please. One at a time. Governor Bush. Thank you. All right. Hugh Hewitt and Dana Bash Hugh go ahead with the next question. Thank you Governor. Senator Rubio? Let's continue this conversation. This is a critically important issue. We will get to we have a lot of time Ms. Fiorina. I want to get to Senator Rubio right now. Let's talk about one of the aspects of your strategy you say the only way to defeat ISIS is with ground forces made up primarily of Sunni-Arab forces. Those Arab nations though as you well know they've conducted less than five percent of the airstrikes and actually none since August. What makes you think they are willing to fight on the ground if they're not even willing to fight from the air? Thank you Senator. Stand by. Ms. Fiorina the former defense secretary Bob Gates says the chances of getting Sunni-Arab forces on the ground to get the job done his words ""chances very remote."" What's your strategy? I know everyone is eager to get started. So candidates please take your places while I explain the ground rules for tonight. As moderator I'll guide the discussion and I'll be joined in the questioning by Salem Radio Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt and CNN's chief political correspondent Dana Bash.

2015-12-15 00:00:00,carson," Thank you Wolf. Please join me for a moment of silence and remembrance of the San Bernardino victims. Thank you. You know our country since its inception has been at war every 15 or 20 years. But the war that we are fighting now against radical Islamist jihadists is one that we must win. Our very existence is dependent upon that.You know as a pediatric neurosurgeon I frequently faced life and death situations and had to come up with the right diagnosis the right plan and execute that plan frequently with other colleagues.Right now the United States of America is the patient. And the patient is in critical condition and will not be cured by political correctness and will not be cured by timidity.And I am asking the Congress which represents the people to declare a war on ISIS so that we can begin the process of excising that cancer and begin the healing process and bring peace prosperity and safety back to America. First of all let me just complain a little bit. This is the first time I've spoken and several people have had multiple questions so please try to pay attention to that. Now as far as monitoring is concerned what my point is we need to make sure that any place I don't care whether it's a mosque a school a supermarket a theater you know it doesn't matter. If there are a lot of people getting there and engaging in radicalizing activities then we need to be suspicious of it. We have to get rid of all this PC stuff. And people are worried about if somebody's going to say that I'm Islamophobic or what have you. This is craziness because we are at war. That's why I asked congress go ahead and declare the war .We need to be on a war footing. We need to understand that our nation is in grave danger. You know what the Muslim Brotherhood said in the explanatory memorandum that was discovered during the Holy Land Foundation Trial was that ""they will take advantage of our PC attitude to get us. :""We have to be better than this. We have to be smarter than they are. I think you have to ask them about that. I don't want to get in between them. Let them fight. Neurosurgeon. Well interestingly enough you should see the eyes of some of those children when I say to them we're going to have to open your head up and take out this tumor. They're not happy about it believe me. And they don't like me very much at that point. But later on they love me. Sometimes you I sound like him. You know later on you know they really realize what's going on. And by the same token you have to be able to look at the big picture and understand that it's actually merciful if you go ahead and finish the job rather than death by 1000 pricks. You got it. You got it. Ruthless is not necessarily the word I would use but tough resolute understanding what the problems are and understanding that the job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of this country and to do what is necessary in order to get it done.

2015-12-15 00:00:00,fiorina," Like all of you I'm angry. I'm angry at what's happening to our nation. Citizens it's time to take our country back. Bombastic insults wont take it back. Political rhetoric that promises a lot and delivers little won't take it back. All of our problems can be solved. All of our wounds can be healed by a tested leader who is willing to fight for the character of our nation.I have been tested. I have beaten breast cancer. I have buried a child. I started as a secretary. I fought my way to the top of corporate America while being called every B word in the book. I fought my way into this election and on to this debate stage while all the political insiders and the pundits told ""it couldn't be done.""I've been told ""no: all my life. And all my life I've refused to accept no as an answer. Citizens it is time to take our country back from the political class from the media from the liberal elite. It can be done it must be done join me and we will get it done. What I think we need to stand for are solutions. I offer myself as a leader to the people of this country because I think they're looking for solutions not lawyers arguing over laws or entertainers throwing out sound bites that draw media attention. We need to solve the problem. To solve the problem we need to do something here at home and something over there in their caliphate. We need to deny them territory.But here at home we need to do two fundamental things. Number one we need to recognize that technology has moved on. The Patriot Act was signed in 2001 roughly. The iPhone was invented in 2007. The iPad was invented in 2011. Snapchat and Twitter all the rest of it have been around just for several years. Technology has moved on and the terrorists have moved on with it.Let me tell you a story. Soon after 9/11 I got a phone call from the NSA. They needed help. I gave them help. I stopped a truckload of equipment. I had it turned around. It was escorted by the NSA into headquarters. We need the private sector's help because government is not innovating. Technology is running ahead by leaps and bound. The private sector will help just as I helped after 9/11. But they must be engaged and they must be asked. I will ask them. I know them. You know listening to this conversation let me just say we have a lot of argument about laws but none of it solves the problem. Let's examine what happened why did we miss the Tsarnaev brothers why did we miss the San Bernardino couple? It wasn't because we had stopped collected metadata it was because I think as someone who comes from the technology world we were using the wrong algorithms. This is a place where the private sector could be helpful because the government is woefully behind the technology curve. But secondly the bureaucratic processes that have been in place since 9/11 are woefully inadequate as well. What do we now know? That DHS vets people by going into databases of known or suspected terrorists.And yet we also know that ISIS is recruiting who are not in those databases. So of course we're going to miss them. And then we now learn that DHS says ""No we can't check their social media.""For heaven's sakes every parent in America is checking social media and every employer is as well but our government can't do it. The bureaucratic procedures are so far behind. Our government has become incompetent unresponsive corrupt. And that incompetence ineptitude lack of accountability is now dangerous.It is why we need a different kind of leadership in the White House that understands how to get bureaucracies competent again. They do not need to be forced. They need to be asked to bring the best and brightest the most recent technology to the table. I was asked as a CEO. I complied happily. And they will as well. But they have not been asked. That's why it cost billions of dollars to build an Obama website that failed because the private sector wasn't asked. I hope at some point you're going to ask me my strategy. Wellenetian Las Vegas. We have a very enthusiastic audience. Everyone is here. They're looking forward to a serious and spirited discussion about the security of this nation.I'm Wolf Blitzer your moderator tonight. This debate is airing on CNN networks here in the United States and around the world and on the Salem Radio Network. The nine leading candidates they are here. Let's welcome them right now.Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Businessman and real estate developer Donald Trump. Retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.

2015-12-15 00:00:00,bush, Our freedom is under attack. Our economy is under water. The leading democrat is under investigation. And America is under the gun to lead the free world to protect our civilized way of life. Serious times require strong leadership that's what at stake right now. Regarding national security we need to restore the defense cuts of Barack Obama to rebuild our military to destroy ISIS before it destroys us. Regarding economic security we need to take power and money away from Washington D.C. and empower American families so that they can rise up again.Look America still is an exceptional country. We love to lead and we love to win. And we do it when we take on any challenge and when we take we support our friends.As president I will keep you and our country safe secure and free.Thank you. Well first of all we need to destroy ISIS in the caliphate. That's that should be our objective. The refugee issue will be solved if we destroy ISIS there which means we need to have a no-fly zone safe zones there for refugees and to build a military force. We need to embed our forces our troops inside the Iraqi military. We need to arm directly the Kurds. And all of that has to be done in concert with the Arab nations. And if we're going to ban all Muslims how are we going to get them to be part of a coalition to destroy ISIS?The Kurds are the greatest fighting force and our strongest allies. They're Muslim. Look this is not a serious proposal. In fact it will push the Muslim world the Arab world away from us at a time when we need to reengage with them to be able to create a strategy to destroy ISIS.So Donald you know is great at at the one-liners but he's a chaos candidate. And he'd be a chaos president. He would not be the commander in chief we need to keep our country safe. Look he mentioned me. I can bring I can talk. This is this is the problem. Banning all Muslims will make it harder for us to do exactly what we need to do which is to destroy ISIS. We need a strategy. We need to get the lawyers off the back of the warfighters. Right now under President Obama we've created this this standard that is so high that it's impossible to be successful in fighting ISIS. We need to engage with the Arab world to make this happen. It is not a serious proposal to say that to the people that you're asking for their support that they can't even come to the country to even engage in a dialogue with us. That's not a serious proposal. We need a serious leader to deal with this. And I believe I'm that guy. They are relevant if we want to destroy ISIS. If we want to destroy radical Islamic terrors we can't disassociate ourselves from peace loving Muslims. If we expect to do this on our own we will fail but if we do it in unison with people who are also are at risk and threatened by Islamic Radical terrorism we'll be far more successful. Look the FBI has the tools necessary un-American activities in our country. It goes on we shouldn't even be talking about it to be honest with you out in the public. Of course they have those capabilities and we should make sure that we give the FBI the NSA our intelligence communities all the resources they need to keep us safe.But the main thing we should be focused on is the strategy to destroy ISIS. And I laid out a plan that the Reagan Library before the tragedy of Paris and before San Bernardino to do just that. It requires leadership it's not filing an amendment and call it a success.It is developing a strategy leading the world funding it to make sure that we have a military that's second to none and doing the job and making sure that we destroy ISIS there. That's how you keep America safe. Donald this has got... This is another example of the lack of seriousness. Look this is this is troubling because we're at war. They've declared war on us and we need to have a serious strategy to destroy ISIS. But the idea that that is a solution to this is just is just crazy. It makes no sense to suggest this. Look two months ago Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight. Just two months ago he said that Hillary Clinton would be a great negotiator with Iran. And he gets his foreign policy experience from the shows.That is not a serious kind of candidate. We need someone that thinks this through. That can lead our country to safety and security. You said on September 30th that ISIS was not a factor. I'm talking right now. I'm talking. September 30th you said... A little of your own medicine there Donald. Donald you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency. That's not going to happen. And I do have the strength. Leadership leadership is not about attacking people and disparaging people. Leadership is about creating a serious strategy to deal with the threat of our time.And I laid out that strategy before the attacks in Paris and before the attacks in San Bernardino. And it is the way forward. We need to increase our military spending. We need to deal with a no- fly zone in Syria a safe zone. We need to focus on building a military that is second-to-none... ... so that we can destroy Islamic terrorism. Our freedom is under attack. Our economy is under water. The leading democrat is under investigation. And America is under the gun to lead the free world to protect our civilized way of life. Serious times require strong leadership that's what at stake right now. Regarding national security we need to restore the defense cuts of Barack Obama to rebuild our military to destroy ISIS before it destroys us. Regarding economic security we need to take power and money away from Washington D.C. and empower American families so that they can rise up again.Look America still is an exceptional country. We love to lead and we love to win. And we do it when we take on any challenge and when we take we support our friends.As president I will keep you and our country safe secure and free.Thank you. Well first of all we need to destroy ISIS in the caliphate. That's that should be our objective. The refugee issue will be solved if we destroy ISIS there which means we need to have a no-fly zone safe zones there for refugees and to build a military force. We need to embed our forces our troops inside the Iraqi military. We need to arm directly the Kurds. And all of that has to be done in concert with the Arab nations. And if we're going to ban all Muslims how are we going to get them to be part of a coalition to destroy ISIS?The Kurds are the greatest fighting force and our strongest allies. They're Muslim. Look this is not a serious proposal. In fact it will push the Muslim world the Arab world away from us at a time when we need to reengage with them to be able to create a strategy to destroy ISIS.So Donald you know is great at at the one-liners but he's a chaos candidate. And he'd be a chaos president. He would not be the commander in chief we need to keep our country safe. Look he mentioned me. I can bring I can talk. This is this is the problem. Banning all Muslims will make it harder for us to do exactly what we need to do which is to destroy ISIS. We need a strategy. We need to get the lawyers off the back of the warfighters. Right now under President Obama we've created this this standard that is so high that it's impossible to be successful in fighting ISIS. We need to engage with the Arab world to make this happen. It is not a serious proposal to say that to the people that you're asking for their support that they can't even come to the country to even engage in a dialogue with us. That's not a serious proposal. We need a serious leader to deal with this. And I believe I'm that guy. They are relevant if we want to destroy ISIS. If we want to destroy radical Islamic terrors we can't disassociate ourselves from peace loving Muslims. If we expect to do this on our own we will fail but if we do it in unison with people who are also are at risk and threatened by Islamic Radical terrorism we'll be far more successful. Look the FBI has the tools necessary un-American activities in our country. It goes on we shouldn't even be talking about it to be honest with you out in the public. Of course they have those capabilities and we should make sure that we give the FBI the NSA our intelligence communities all the resources they need to keep us safe.But the main thing we should be focused on is the strategy to destroy ISIS. And I laid out a plan that the Reagan Library before the tragedy of Paris and before San Bernardino to do just that. It requires leadership it's not filing an amendment and call it a success.It is developing a strategy leading the world funding it to make sure that we have a military that's second to none and doing the job and making sure that we destroy ISIS there. That's how you keep America safe. Donald this has got... This is another example of the lack of seriousness. Look this is this is troubling because we're at war. They've declared war on us and we need to have a serious strategy to destroy ISIS. But the idea that that is a solution to this is just is just crazy. It makes no sense to suggest this. Look two months ago Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight. Just two months ago he said that Hillary Clinton would be a great negotiator with Iran. And he gets his foreign policy experience from the shows.That is not a serious kind of candidate. We need someone that thinks this through. That can lead our country to safety and security. You said on September 30th that ISIS was not a factor. I'm talking right now. I'm talking. September 30th you said... A little of your own medicine there Donald. Donald you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency. That's not going to happen. And I do have the strength. Leadership leadership is not about attacking people and disparaging people. Leadership is about creating a serious strategy to deal with the threat of our time.And I laid out that strategy before the attacks in Paris and before the attacks in San Bernardino. And it is the way forward. We need to increase our military spending. We need to deal with a no- fly zone in Syria a safe zone. We need to focus on building a military that is second-to-none... ... so that we can destroy Islamic terrorism.
2015-12-15 00:00:00,kasich," Thank you Wolf. Just last weekend just last week a friend asked one of my daughters ""Do you like politics?"" And my daughter said ""No I don't. And the reason I don't like it is because there's too much fighting too much yelling. It's so loud I don't like it."" You know I turned to my friend and I said ""You know she's really on to something."" And when we think about our country and the big issues that we face in this country; creating jobs making sure people can keep their jobs the need for rising wages whether our children when they graduate from college can find a job protecting the homeland destroying ISIS rebuilding defense. These are all the things that we need to focus on but we'll never get there if we're divided. We'll never get there if republicans and democrats just fight with one another.Frankly we are republicans and they're democrats but before all of that we're Americans. And I believe we need to unify in so many ways to rebuild our country to strengthen our country to rebuild our defense and for America to secure it's place it world; for us for our children and for the next generation.Thank you. Well first of all Wolf I said last February that we needed to have people on the ground troops on the ground in a coalition similar to what we had in the first Gulf War. I remember when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States stood in the Rose Garden and pledged Arab commitment to removing Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. Before we came out here tonight I am told that the Saudis have organized 34 countries who want to join in the battle against terrorism.First and foremost we need to go and destroy ISIS. And we need to do this with our Arab friends and our friends in Europe.And when I see they have a climate conference over in Paris they should have been talking about destroying ISIS because they are involved in virtually every country you know across this world. Now you destroy ISIS in a coalition. You get joint intelligence with our European friends. And then here at home there are things called the Joint Terrorism Task Force headed by the FBI and made up of local law enforcement including state police.They need the tools. And the tools involve encryption where we cannot hear what they're even planning. And when we see red flags a father a mother a neighbor who says we have got a problem here then we have to give law enforcement the ability to listen so they can disrupt these terrorist attacks before they occur.We can do this but we've got to get moving. Pay me now or pay me a lot more later. This is the direction we need to go. No I don't think it is. And I want to go back to two other issues. One is the metadata. We know we have to hold this data for a longer period of time. And you know in a lot of ways Chris is right. Look what a president has to do is take a position. We don't want to err on the side of having less. We want to err on the side of having more. That's good for our families. In addition to that Wolf there is a big problem. It's called encryption. And the people in San Bernardino were communicating with people who the FBI had been watching. But because their phone was encrypted because the intelligence officials could not see who they were talking to it was lost.We have to solve the encryption problem. It is not easy. A president of the United States again has to bring people together have a position. We need to be able to penetrate these people when they are involved in these plots and these plans. And we have to give the local authorities the ability to penetrate to disrupt. That's what we need to do. Encryption is a major problem and Congress has got to deal with this and so does the president to keep us safe. Yeah let me let me just suggest to everybody and I hear last February I said we needed to have people on the ground in a coalition with Europe and our allies. This is not going to get done just by working with the Sunnis. And it is not going to get done if we just embed a few people. We have to go massively like we did in the first Gulf War where we destroyed Saddam's ability to take Kuwait. We need to have a coalition that will stand for nothing less than the total destruction of ISIS and we have to be the leader. We can't wait for anybody else. I served on the Armed Services Committee for 18 years and we must lead or the job won't get done unfortunately for our country Thank you Wolf.

2015-12-15 00:00:00,cruz," Thank you Wolf. America is at war. Our enemy is not violent extremism. It is not some unnamed malevolent force. It is radical Islamic terrorist. We have a president who is unwilling to utter its name. The men and women on this stage every one of us is better prepared to keep this nation safe than is Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton.We need a president who understands the first obligation of the commander-in-chief is to keep America safe. If I am elected president we will hunt down and kill the terrorists. We will utterly destroy ISIS.We will stop the terrorist attacks before they occur because we will not be prisoners to political correctness. Rather we will speak the truth. Border security is national security and we will not be admitting jihadists as refugees.We will keep America safe. Well listen Hugh everyone understands why Donald has suggested what he has. We're looking at a president who's engaged in this double-speak where he doesn't call radical Islamic terrorism by its name. Indeed he gives a speech after the San Bernardino attack where his approach is to try to go after the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens rather than to keep us safe. And even worse President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing bringing tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to this country when the head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees.I understand why Donald made that proposal. I introduced legislation in the Senate that I believe is more narrowly focused at the actual threat which is radical Islamic terrorism and what my legislation would do is suspend all refugees for three years from countries where ISIS or Al Qaida control substantial territory. Well you know I'm reminded of what FDR's grandfather said. He said ""All horse-thieves are Democrats but not all Democrats are horse-thieves."" In this instance there are millions of peaceful Muslims across the world in countries like India where there is not the problems we are seeing in nations that are controlled have territory controlled by Al Qaida or ISIS and we should direct at the problem focus on the problem and defeat radical Islamic terrorism. It's not a war on a faith; it's a war on a political and theocratic ideology that seeks to murder us. Well Dana the premise of your question is not accurate. I'm very proud to have joined with conservatives in both the Senate and the House to reform how we target bad guys. And what the USA Freedom Act did is it did two things. Number one it ended the federal government's bulk collection of phone metadata of millions of law-abiding citizens.But number two in the second half of it that is critical. It strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. It gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in San Bernardino.And in particular what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. When you had a terrorist you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers primarily land lines.The USA Freedom Act expands that so now we have cell phones now we have Internet phones now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys.You know what the Obama administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens they focus on law-abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys.We need to focus on radical Islamic terrorists and we need to stop them before they carry out acts of terror. Well you know I would note that Marco knows what he's saying isn't true. You know Mark Levin wrote a column last week that says that the attack ads his Super PAC is running that are saying the same thing that they are knowingly false and they are in fact Alinsky-like attacks like Barack Obama. And the reason is simple. What he knows is that the old program covered 20 percent to 30 percent of phone numbers to search for terrorists. The new program covers nearly 100 percent. That gives us greater ability to stop acts of terrorism and he knows that that's the case. What it means is using overwhelming air power to utterly and completely destroy ISIS. To put things in perspective in the first Persian Gulf War we launched roughly 1100 air attacks a day. We carpet bombed them for 36 days saturation bombing after which our troops went in and in a day and a half mopped up what was left of the Iraqi army. Right now Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. It is photo op foreign policy. We need to use overwhelming air power. We need to be arming the Kurds. We need to be fighting and killing ISIS where they are.And let me go back to the earlier discussion a minute ago. It's not a lack of competence that is preventing the Obama administration from stopping these attacks. It is political correctness. We didn't monitor the Facebook posting of the female San Bernardino terrorist because the Obama DHS thought it would be inappropriate. She made a public call to jihad and they didn't target it.The Tsarnaev brothers the elder brother made a public call to jihad and the Obama administration didn't target it. Nidal Hasan communicated with Anwar al-Awlaki a known radical cleric asked about waging jihad against his fellow soldiers. The problem is because of political correctness the Obama administration like a lot of folks here want to search everyone's cell phones and e-mails and not focus on the bad guys. And political correctness is killing people. You would carpet bomb where ISIS is not a city but the location of the troops. You use air power directed and you have embedded special forces to direction the air power. But the object isn't to level a city. The object is to kill the ISIS terrorists. To make it listen ISIS is gaining strength because the perception is that they're winning. And President Obama fuels that perception. That will change when militants across the globe see that when you join ISIS that you are giving up your life you are signing your death warrant and we need a president who is focused on defeating every single ISIS terrorist and protecting the homeland which should be the first priority. Well you know Marco has continued these attacks and he knows they're not true. Yes it is true that I voted against the National Defense Authorization Act because when I campaigned in Texas I told voters in Texas that I would oppose the federal government having the authority to detain U.S. citizens permanently with no due process. I have repeatedly supported an effort to take that out of that bill and I honored that campaign commitment. But more broadly you know the notion Marco is suggesting that somehow he also has tossed more than a few insults this direction let's be absolutely clear. ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism will face no more determined foe than I will be. We will utterly destroy them by targeting the bad guys. And one of the problems with Marco's foreign policy is he has far too often supported Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama undermining governments in the Middle East that have helped radical Islamic terrorists.We need to focus on killing the bad guys not getting stuck in Middle Eastern civil wars that don't keep America safe. Thank you Wolf. America is at war. Our enemy is not violent extremism. It is not some unnamed malevolent force. It is radical Islamic terrorist.

2015-12-15 00:00:00,paul," The question is how do we keep America safe from terrorism? Trump says we ought to close that Internet thing. The question really is what does he mean by that? Like they do in North Korea? Like they do in China? Rubio says we should collect all Americans' records all of the time. The Constitution says otherwise. I think they're both wrong. I think we defeat terrorism by showing them that we do not fear them. I think if we ban certain religions if we censor the Internet I think that at that point the terrorists will have won. Regime change hasn't won. Toppling secular dictators in the Middle East has only led to chaos and the rise of radical Islam. I think if we want to defeat terrorism I think if we truly are sincere about defeating terrorism we need to quit arming the allies of ISIS. If we want to defeat terrorism the boots on the ground the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots on the ground.As commander-in-chief I will do whatever it takes to defend America. But in defending America we cannot lose what America stands for. Today is the Bill of Rights' anniversary. I hope we will remember that and cherish that in the fight on terrorism. You know I think Marco gets it completely wrong. We are not any safer through the bulk collection of all Americans' records. In fact I think we're less safe. We get so distracted by all of the information we're not spending enough time getting specific immigration specific information on terrorists. The other thing is is the one thing that might have stopped San Bernardino that might have stopped 9/11 would have been stricter controls on those who came here. And Marco has opposed at every point increased security border security for those who come to our country.On his Gang of Eight bill he would have liberalized immigration but he did not and he steadfastly opposed any new border security requirements for refugees or students.Last week I introduced another bill saying we need more security we need more scrutiny. Once again Marco opposed this. So Marco can't have it both ways. He thinks he wants to be this ""Oh I'm great and strong on national defense."" But he's the weakest of all the candidates on immigration. He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless. If we want to defend the country we have to defend against who's coming in and Marco is has more of an allegiance to Chuck Schumer and to the liberals than he does to conservative policy. If I was mentioned in the question can I respond? Marco still misunderstands the immigration issue. What I put forward was an amendment that would have temporarily halted immigration from high-risk terrorist countries but would have started it up but I wanted them to go through Global Entry which is a program where we do background checks. The thing is is that every terrorist attack we've had since 9/11 has been legal immigration. Marco wants to expand that. I want more rules more scrutiny and to defend the country you have to defend the border. Wolf... Wolf this legislation... This legislation on indefinite detention... ... I think deserves a little more attention. I think that by arming the allies of ISIS the Islamic rebels against Assad that we created a safe space or made that space bigger for ISIS to grow. I think those who have wanted regime change have made a mistake. When we toppled Gadhafi in Libya I think that was a mistake. I think ISIS grew stronger we had a failed state and we were more at risk. I'd like to also go back to though another question which is is Donald Trump a serious candidate? The reason I ask this is if you're going to close the Internet realize America what that entails. That entails getting rid of the First amendment OK? It's no small feat.If you are going to kill the families of terrorists realize that there's something called the Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of. It would defy every norm that is America. So when you ask yourself whoever you are that think you're going to support Donald Trump think do you believe in the Constitution? Are you going to change the Constitution? I think that if you believe in regime change you're mistaken. In 2013 we put 600 tons of weapons us Saudi Arabia and Qatar into the war against Assad. By pushing Assad back we did create a safe space. We had people coming to our Foreign Relations Committee and saying ""Oh we need to arm the allies of Al Qaida."" They are still saying this. It is a crazy notion. This is the biggest debate we should be having tonight is is regime change a good idea; has it been a good idea.There are still people the majority on the stage they want to topple Assad. And then there will be chaos and I think ISIS will then be in charge of Syria. The question is how do we keep America safe from terrorism? Trump says we ought to close that Internet thing. The question really is what does he mean by that? Like they do in North Korea? Like they do in China? Rubio says we should collect all Americans' records all of the time. The Constitution says otherwise. I think they're both wrong. I think we defeat terrorism by showing them that we do not fear them.

It would defy every norm that is America. So when you ask yourself whoever you are that think you're going to support Donald Trump think do you believe in the Constitution? Are you going to change the Constitution? I think that if you believe in regime change you're mistaken. In 2013 we put 600 tons of weapons us Saudi Arabia and Qatar into the war against Assad. By pushing Assad back we did create a safe space. We had people coming to our Foreign Relations Committee and saying ""Oh we need to arm the allies of Al Qaida."" They are still saying this. It is a crazy notion. This is the biggest debate we should be having tonight is is regime change a good idea; has it been a good idea.There are still people the majority on the stage they want to topple Assad. And then there will be chaos and I think ISIS will then be in charge of Syria."
2015-12-15 00:00:00,hewitt, Senator Cruz you've said you disagree with Mr. Trump's policy. I don't want a cage match; you've tweeted you don't want a cage match. But Republican primary voters deserve to know with the kind of specificity and responsiveness you delivered in your nine Supreme Court arguments how you disagree with Mr. Trump. Would you spell that out with us? So you're saying you disagree because he's too broad and you have a narrower focus? Why do you disagree with him? Carly Fiorina... ... this is the Christmas dinner debate. This will be the debate that Americans talk about at Christmas. And thus far in the first 10 minutes we haven't heard a lot about Ronald Reagan's city on a hill. We've heard a lot about keeping Americans out or keeping Americans safe and everyone else out. Is this what you want the party to stand for? Dr. Carson... ... you mentioned in your opening remarks that you're a pediatric neurologist surgeon... Neurosurgeon. And people admire and respect and are inspired by your life story your kindness your evangelical core support. We're talking about ruthless things tonight carpet bombing toughness war. And people wonder could you do that? Could you order air strikes that would kill innocent children by not the scores but the hundreds and the thousands? Could you wage war as a commander-in-chief? So you are OK with the deaths of thousands of innocent children and civilian? It's like... That is what war can you be as ruthless as Churchill was in prosecuting the war against the Nazis?

2015-12-15 00:00:00,bash, A crucial question is how to balance surveillance with privacy and keeping Americans safe. Senator Cruz you voted for a bill that President Obama signed into law just this past June that made it harder for the government to access Americans' phone records. In light of the San Bernardino attack was your vote a mistake? Thank you. Senator Rubio Senator Cruz is right there was bipartisan support for that. But you voted against it. So is Senator Cruz wrong? Senator Cruz? Senator Senator Senator Rubio please respond. Senator Paul Senator Paul I know this is this has been a very big issue for you.

Senator Paul Senator Paul I want to go back to my initial question which is you saying that ISIS grew stronger because of hawks in your party.

2016-01-28 00:00:00,webb," I hope I can get that kind of time here. As a President of the United States every life in this country matters. At the same time I believe I can say to you I have had a long history of working with the situation of African Americans. We're talking about criminal justice reform I risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when I ran for the Senate in Virginia in 2006. I had democratic party political consultants telling me I was committing political suicide. We led that issue in the congress. We started a national debate on it. And it wasn't until then that the Republican Party started joining in. I also represented a so-called war criminal an African American Marine who was wounded who was convicted of murder in Vietnam for six years. He took his life three years into this. I cleared his name after after three years. And I put the African American soldier on the Mall. I made that recommendation and fought for it. So if you want someone who is can stand up in front of you right now and say I have done the hard job I have taken the risks I am your person. Bernie say my name so I can get into this. OK. Thank you. Anderson I need to jump in (inaudible). There is a reality that I think we all need to recognize with respect to the power of the financial sector. And let me just go back a minute and say that on this TARP program I introduced a piece of legislation calling for a windfall profits tax on the executives of any of these companies that got more than $5 billion that it was time for them once they got their compensation and their bonus to split the rest of the money they made with the nurses and the truck drivers and the soldiers who bailed them out. With respect to the financial sector I mean I know that my time has run out but in speaking of changing positions and the position on how this debate has occurred is kind of frustrating because unless somebody mentions my name I can't get into the discussion. All right. Well I'm trying to set a mark here so maybe we can get into a little more later on. This hasn't been equal time. But if you want to look at what has happened if we look at the facts in terms of how we're going to deal with this since that crash in the last 10 years the amount of the world's capital economy that Wall Street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent. That means the Wall Street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the American people are when they're going to get their compensation. They're managing money from all over the world. We have to take that into consideration when we're looking at ways to regulate it. I wouldn't have a problem with that. Let me start by saying my wife is an immigrant. She was a refugee her family escaped from Vietnam on a boat-- her entire extended family after the communists took over when hundreds of thousands of people were out there and thousands of them were dying. Went to two refugee camps she never spoke English in her home and she ended as I said graduating from Cornell Law School. That's not only American dream that's a value that we have with a good immigration system in place. No country has is a country without defining its borders. We need to resolve this issue. I actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill... ...Giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here and put down their roots and met as a series of standards... ...lost (ph) I introduced that in 2007 We need a comprehensive reform and we need to be able to define our borders. I well I I would leave his ultimate judgment to the legal system. Here's what I do believe. We have a serious problem in terms of the collection of personal information in this country. And one of the things that I did during the FISA bill in 2007 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was introduce with Russ Feingold two amendments basically saying ""We understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the Internet age but after a certain period of time you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them."" We've got a vast data bank of information that is ripe for people with bad intentions to be able to use. And they need to be destroyed. I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders but I Bernie I don't think the revolution's going to come. And I don't think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff. And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration it would be in the use of executive authority. I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee. I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we're doing. So I would lead working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets (ph). Well the the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change? And when I was in the Senate I was an all-of-the-above energy voter. We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power. I'm a strong proponent of nuclear power. It is safe it is clean. And really we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here. We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem and I have been very strong on on doing that. The the agreements the so-called agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the of the Chinese government itself. So let's solve this problem in an international way and then we really will have a a way to address climate change."
2016-01-28 00:00:00,sanders," Well first of all let's remember where we were when Bush left office. We were losing 800000 jobs a month. And I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue but the world's financial crisis was on the world's financial markets system was on the verge of collapse. That's where we were. Are we better off today than we were then? Absolutely. But the truth is that for the 40 years the great middle class of this country has been disappearing. And in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; pay equity for women workers; and our disastrous trade policies which have cost us millions of jobs; and make every public college and university in this country tuition free. Well that's not true. Let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street where fraud is a business model helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people. Check the record. In the 1990s and all due respect in the 1990s when I had the Republican leadership and Wall Street spending billions of dollars in lobbying when the Clinton administration when Alan Greenspan said ""what a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge"" Bernie Sanders fought them and helped lead the opposition to deregulation. Today it is my view that when you have the three... ...largest banks in America are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being too big to fail we have got to break them up. I will just a second. I'll tell him. In my view Secretary Clinton you do not Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress. And we have gotta break off these banks. Going to them... ...and saying ""please do the right thing""... ...is kind of naive. Well I remember that meeting very well. I remember it like it was yesterday. Hank Paulson Bernanke came in and they say ""guys the economy is going to collapse because Wall Street is going under. It's gonna take the economy with them."" And you know what I said to Hank Paulson? I said ""Hank your guys you come from Goldman Sachs. Your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem. How about your millionaire and billionaire friends paying for the bailout not working families in this country?"" So to answer your question no I would not have let the economy collapse. But it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out Wall Street. And by the way I want Wall Street now to help kids in this country go to college public colleges and universities free with a Wall Street speculation tax. Well let me tell you Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today taxes in the future than they're paying today. But in terms of education this is what I think. This is the year 2015. A college degree today Dana is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago. And what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family. I think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college. I think we don't need a complicated system which the secretary is talking about the income goes down the income goes down if you're poor you have to work and so forth and so on. I pay for my program by the way through a tax on Wall Street speculation which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt a major crisis in this country. ... in order to make it possible for them to afford their education. And I want colleges to get their costs down. They are outrageously high in what they're charging. When the Republicans when the Republicans in the Congress and some Democrats were talking about cutting Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans for the so-called chained CPI I founded a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus. My view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by and I don't know how they do on $11000 $12000 $13000 a year you don't cut Social Security you expand it. And the way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes so that you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making $118000. You do that Social Security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits. I didn't leave anybody at the altar. I voted against that piece of legislation because it had guest-worker provisions in it which the Southern Poverty Law Center talked about being semi-slavery. Guest workers are coming in they're working under terrible conditions but if they stand up for their rights they're thrown out of the country. I was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason. Tom Harkin a very good friend of Hillary Clinton's and mine one of the leading labor advocates also voted against that. I know that. But point being is that progressives did vote against that for that reason. My view right now and always has been is that when you have 11 million undocumented people in this country we need comprehensive immigration reform we need a path toward citizenship we need to take people out of the shadows. Well I was chairman for two years and when I was chairman we did take action. What we did is pass a $15 billion dollar piece of legislation which brought in many many new doctors and nurses into the V.A. so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it and not be on long waiting lines. And the other part of that legislation said that if a veteran is living more than 40 miles away from a V.A. facility that veteran could get health care from the community health center or the private sector. As a result of that legislation we went further in than any time in recent history in improving health care for the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend them. It was 99 to one and I was maybe the one. I don't know. I'm sorry? Absolutely. Of course. Well I would shut down make I'd shut down what exists right now is that virtually every telephone call in this country ends up in a file at the NSA. That is unacceptable to me. But it's not just government surveillance. I think the government is involved in our e-mails; is involved in our websites. Corporate America is doing it as well. If we are a free country we have the right to be free. Yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but there are ways to do that without impinging on our constitutional rights and our privacy rights. O'MALLEY (?): Anderson the NSA... I think Snowden played a very important role in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined. He did he did break the law and I think there should be a penalty to that. But I think what he did in educating us should be taken into consideration before he is (inaudible). I have a lot of respect for president Obama. I have worked with him time and time again on many many issues. But here's where I do disagree. I believe that the power of corporate America the power of Wall Street the power of the drug companies the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform America and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say: Our government is going to work for all of us not just a handful of billionaires. What I mean is that we need to have one of the larger voter turnouts in the world not one of the lowest. We need to raise public consciousness. We need the American people to know what's going on in Washington in a way that today they do not know. And when people come together in a way that does not exist now and are prepared to take on the big money interest then we could bring the kind of change we need. I think I think that there is profound frustration all over this country with establishment politics. I am the only candidate running for president who is not a billionaire who has raised substantial sums of money and I do not have a super PAC. I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires and in fact tonight in terms of what a political revolution is about there are 4000 house parties 100000 people in this country watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country. Well I will tell you this. I believe and Pope Francis made this point. This is a moral issue. The scientists are telling us that we need to move extremely boldly. I am proud that along with Senator Barbara Boxer a few years ago we introduced the first piece of climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon. And let me also tell you that nothing is gonna happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform because the fossil fuel industry is funding the Republican Party which denies the reality of climate change... ...and certainly is not prepared to go forward aggressively. This is a moral issue. We have got to be extremely aggressive in working with China India Russia. The planet the future of the planet is at stake."
2016-01-28 00:00:00,baier," Nine p.m. on the East Coast. Eight o'clock here in Des Moines Iowa. Welcome to the seventh Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. I'm Bret Baier along with my comoderators Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace. Google sees political searches spike during televised presidential debates no surprise there. But they spike by more than 440 percent on average as voters across America seek to learn more about what's happening on the live debate stage. Ohio Governor John Kasich. And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Tonight's rules are simple. Up to 60 seconds for each answer 30 seconds for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time you will hear this. Double. I think the double is the one we want. Very pleasing. We have a crowd of about 1600 here and while they have agreed to respect the candidates and listen intently we can tell you they are very excited to be here. Am I right? Governor Bush it's hard for anyone of your pedigree to avoid being called establishment. But isn't that part of the problem in this race that three others on this stage are splitting the main stream Republican vote and there by possibly handing this nomination over to an anti-establishment candidate? Thank you governor. Senator Paul you are definitely not in the establishment category. But at the beginning of this campaign you said you were your own man when asked about your father former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul. Senator Cruz's campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your father's 2012 campaign and the liberty movement. And your father now says it's realistic that Donald Trump will be your party's nominee.So did you make a mistake by not fully more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign? Senator Cruz your response to that? Senator Rubio? Thank you Senator. We'll come back to... OK. Go ahead go ahead. Welcome back. Let's get right back to the questions. Chris. Governor Bush just today a wounded warrior organization designed to help wounded veterans and their families is coming under fire for raising tens of millions of dollars but spending almost half of that on travel and hotels and dinners and luxury lavish conferences. So taking care of veterans is obviously a huge issue in the country that has asked so many to serve and sacrifice so much. If you were president. would you police these charity organizations that say they're helping vets? Governor Bush thank you. Speaking of veterans we have a question from a veteran who is one of the top Youtube creators. Over the course of the evening gentlemen we will hear from some of Youtube's most followed stars. And here's one of them. Senator Paul that question to you. Senator Paul thank you. Thank you Megyn. Gentlemen I'll ask you some questions about federal spending and the role of the federal government. Everybody always said they want to cut federal spending and usually they start by saying they'll cut waste fraud and abuse but that really doesn't ever materialize. We all know that.Governor Christie you talk a lot about entitlement reform and you say that that's where the federal government can get savings needed to balance the budget. But can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all? I want one. Yes. Anything bigger than that? And Governor I realize everyone on this stage opposes Obamacare and you're not alone. Google Data shows that in the last month when people searched ""policy repeals"" that there were a lot of them. Obamacare took the top two spots. But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it. So the question Senator Cruz if you repeal Obamacare as you say you will will you be fine if millions of those people don't have health insurance? And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured? Senator Cruz thank you. Governor Bush you've advocated for statehood for Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden. Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed. So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed bail out Puerto Rico as well? Governor Kasich you're one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race. Your colleague Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is under fire he and his administration for the Flint Michigan water crisis and the botched response to it. How would you have handled that? Senator Rubio on the issue of climate change in 2008 you wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap- and-trade system a program for carbon emissions which many Republicans thought at the time would hurt the Florida economy. Now you're a skeptic of climate change science. And in fact you warn that federal efforts to fight climate change will cost U.S. jobs and hurt the U.S. economy. So why the change? Thanks Senator."

You can see the campaigns respond to the debate in real time and you can weigh in by voting on the topics being discussed. Just go to google.com or open your Google search app and type in Fox News debate. Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Apparently Iowa's near Kentucky. Senator Rubio I want to explore this sort of larger issue. The campaign has in a sense turned into a battle for the soul of the Republican party: establishment versus grassroots pragmatic versus principle. You say that you can unite all of the factions inside the GOP. How? Governor Kasich I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year. You call yourself a quote ""inside-outside guy a reformer who knows how to get things done"" but you reject the establishment label. First question is why do you reject it? And secondly what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset? Dr. Carson I want to pick up on that with you. Governor Kasich likes to say he knows how to land the plane. You've landed a lot of planes in the O.R. But what about the idea of running for president with no experience in government at all? Gentlemen we're now going to start to drill down into specific issues that are on voters' minds. I'm going to start with one of the biggest ones which is foreign terror. According to Google ISIS was by far the most searched foreign policy topic over the last year. Senator Cruz you talk tough about fighting terrorism. You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion. You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night. But critics say that your record does not match up to that. You opposed giving President Obama authority to enforce his red line in Syria. Three years in a row now you have voted against the Defense Authorization Act.How do you square your rhetoric with your record sir? Senator Rubio does Senator Cruz's record match his rhetoric? Senator Cruz you've got 30 seconds. You were mentioned. Gentlemen. May I may I just say we are going to continue the questions about foreign terror gentlemen right after this break. Thank you. Governor Christie you have compared both Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama saying that we cannot afford another inexperienced President. You've also said that Senator Cruz's vote to curtail the NSA surveillance program made America less safe. Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief? Governor Bush... ... I don't think that your name was mentioned... ... Sir I think I think the question was... ... It's not my question that you get a chance to respond to it's his answer. You don't get 30 seconds to respond to me... ... You don't get 30 seconds to respond to me... ... If I could go on. Sir I know you like to argue about the rules but we're going to conduct a debate... ... Governor Bush... Governor Bush here's the question I'm going to ask Governor Bush the question. You criticized several candidates in this field on this stage for what you call unrealistic ideas about how to fight terrorists including Rubio and Cruz on the issue of their refusing to give the President authority to enforce the redline in Syria.But given the fact that your brother got us into two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have still not ended.That have still not ended what lessons have you learned from his mistakes sir? Senator Cruz now you get a chance to respond. ... It is a debate sir. I think the questions were about issues. Senator Rubio what would you like to respond sir... Thank you. Good. Senator Paul go ahead. Well... ... we'll be talking about foreign policy a little bit later. We're going to talk... This debate is just getting started. Coming up the role of the federal government. But first join tonight's conversation right from your home.

2016-01-28 00:00:00,question, I'm Mark Watson. I'm known for my views on Youtube but I'm also a veteran who served in the Army for eight years. As an African-American living near Ferguson I've seen the strain between police officers and the communities they serve firsthand. Now there are great tools like body cameras that to protect both officers and citizens but we all currently have better cameras in our pockets than in our precincts. Why aren't we using the technology available to better protect our communities?
2016-01-28 00:00:00,chafee, The Glass-Steagall was my very first vote I'd just arrived my dad had died in office I was appointed to the office it was my very first vote. I'd just arrived at the Senate. I think we'd get some takeovers and that was one. It was my very first vote and it was 92-5. It was the... But let me just say... I think you're being a little rough. I'd just arrived at the United States Senate. I'd been mayor of my city. My dad had died. I'd been appointed by the governor. It was the first vote and it was 90-5 because it was a conference report. But let me just say about income inequality. We've had a lot of talk over the last few minutes hours or tens of minutes but no one is saying how we're going to fix it. And it all started with the Bush tax cuts that favored the wealthy. So let's go back to the tax code. And 0.6 percent of Americans are at the top echelon over 464000 0.6 Americans. That's less than 1 percent. But they generate 30 percent of the revenue. And they're doing fine. So there's still a lot more money to be had from this top echelon. I'm saying let's have another tier and put that back into the tax bracket. And that will generate $42 billion. And then we can help the middle class and hard-earning Americans hard-working Americans. No that was another 99 to one vote for the Patriot Act and it was seen as at the time modernizing our ability to do what we've always done to tap phones which always required a warrant. And I voted for that. No no. As long as you're getting a warrant I believe that under the Fourth Amendment you should be able to do surveillance but you need a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says. And in the Patriot Act section 215 started to get broadened too far. So I would be in favor of addressing and reforming section 215 of the Patriot Act. No I would bring him home. The courts have ruled that what he did what he did was say the American... ... the American government was acting illegally. That's what the federal courts have said; what Snowden did showed that the American government was acting illegally for the Fourth Amendment. So I would bring him home. Certainly ending the wars. We've got to stop these wars. You have to have a new dynamic a new paradigm. We just spent a half-billion dollars arming and training soldiers the rebel soldiers in Syria. They quickly join the other side. We bombed the... I'd like to finish my question my answer. And also we just bombed a hospital. We've had drone strikes that hit civilian weddings. So I would change how we our approach to the Middle East. We need a new paradigm in the Middle East.
2016-01-28 00:00:00,rubio," Chris let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about. It's not about Donald Trump. He's an entertaining guy. He's the greatest show on earth. This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special. You see we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America. Barack Obama wants to change America. Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world. We want to be the United States of America. That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election. Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice. The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court? I don't think so. If I'm our nominee I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama. I think you know Rand and I have some significant issues on policy but I respect Rand. He believes everything he stands for. I do respect Rand.But I want to be frank about what I stand for. I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world. And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group this apocalyptic group called ISIS.That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities. And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are. And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive they are going to Guantanamo Bay Cuba and we're going to find out everything they know because when I'm president unlike Barack Obama we will keep this country safe. Well again I mean obviously as already has been pointed out the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending. And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason. ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries. ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides. ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said mis-said that wrong once time the city of Dabiq in Syria. They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown. This group needs to be confronted and defeated. They are not going to go away on their own. They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes. They need to be defeated militarily and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.Today we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II the smallest Navy in 100 years the smallest Air Force in our history. You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished. When I'm president we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world. ... First of all Let me go first and then you can please recognize Rand after. First of all... ... do I go let me go first and then you can please recognize Rand after. But... ... first of all... ... first of all I'm don't worry I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me. And second of all... ... and I think you know Governor Jeb you the attack that the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS. It was against Assad. And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small. I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity. So it was not against ISIS it was against it was against Assad.I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict... ...and that do not allow us to pursue victory. When I'm president that will change. Megyn that's the problem. Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk. It's hate action. They blow people up. Look what they did in San Bernardino. Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia that the White House still refuses to link to terror where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.He told the police ""I did it because I was inspired by ISIS"" and to this day the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.Look the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented. There has never been a jihadist group like this. They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.We must keep America safe from this threat. And yes when I am president of the United States if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States we will go after them wherever they are and if we capture them alive they are going to Guantanamo. Might I respond? The first thing I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. I think we all support that. Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming. And that's why I've been clear when I am the president of the United States of America we don't know who you are and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States you are not going to get in because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented... ... and when I'm president we are keeping ISIS out of America. Well Bret first that's not entirely the story. At the time the liberal governor of Florida who claimed he was a Republican his name was Charlie Crist he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida. And I opposed it. I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it. And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time both the Republican and the Democrats all supported it. And what we said is if they're going to impose this on us we better prepare to protect the state from it. But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time.And I do not believe it's a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment but will be devastating for our economy.When I am president of the United States of America there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States. Never support. Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered or stayed in this country illegally. First of all earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. It's what they call it. And the reality of it is this it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally and knowingly did so. You cannot grant amnesty. If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration. They will never again support it and that's wrong for our country bad for our future. No because if you look at the quote and it's very specific. And it says blanket amnesty I do not support blanket amnesty... ... I do not support amnesty... ... No I said I do not support blanket amnesty... ... It was... ... It absolutely has been and at the time in the context of that was in 2009 and 2010 where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate. It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward. What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved. They've been talking about this issue for 30 years and nothing ever happens. And I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.Number one we're going to keep ISIS out of America. If we don't know who you are or why you're coming you will not get into the United States.Number two we're going to enforce our immigration laws. I am the son and grandson of immigrants. And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.We'll hire 20000 new border agents instead of 20000 new IRS agents. We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs. We'll have mandatory E-verify a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control nothing else is going to happen.We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards either. There will be a process. We will see what the American people are willing to support. But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us. May I respond? It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book. That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship. Well but you changed the in the book... You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization. And the bottom line is this we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control. The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens. It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way shape or form until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control. And when I'm president we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it. But Megyn... There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws. That is abundantly clear. You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach. The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor after two unconstitutional executive orders the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control. And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue."
2016-01-28 00:00:00,christie, They're not wrong. But what's wrong is your premise in the question. You can do both. There is no reason why you can't stand for principles go and fight for them and be able also to have to get things done in government. You know what people are frustrated about in Washington D.C.. and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them. You know for the 45-year-old construction worker out there who is having a hard time making things meet.He's lost $4000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration. He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots. And who's compromised and who is principled. What he wants is something to get done.And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions. Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable. I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature I've gotten conservative things done. That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States. Well let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe. Well let me tell you what the country should really be worried about. I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan and that's what Iowans like to do. They like to ask direct questions. And they asked about her email situation. And here's what she said to the American people. She did it for convenience. For her convenience. She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience. She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience. She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States Chris. Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country. She is not qualified to be President of the United States. The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested who has been through it who has made decisions who has sit in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on... ... that stage and that is exactly what I am ready to do. Talk about what? I... Well because you can do it without profiling Megyn when you do it on the facts. What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons. They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it. That's not profiling that's law enforcement. And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before. They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people Megyn. They knew that. Listen I think that what people should do is use their common sense. And the fact is let law enforcement make those decisions. I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago. It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal or profiling or not. You see something that's suspicious you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.That's what should be done. That can be done. That can be done without profiling people. What that is is just common sense. They thought something was wrong.And here's the problem in this country right now. The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.They're not supporting our law enforcement officers it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer. It's making... ... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer. It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement. As president I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community. Yes. You want one? How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years. That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America. Bigger than that? Let me tell you something when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb I can't think of anything better than that.
2016-01-28 00:00:00,carson, Well I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title. You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me but you will hear the truth. And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth. In fact sometimes it's not that way... ... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together making life and death decisions put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before. And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before. We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people to focus on the problem and solve the problem. The American people are terrified. That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now. We don't need more of the same solutions. We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation. Well I don't know about the GOP messaging but I can tell you about my messaging. You know need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies because it's going to kill us if we don't. And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas they had a memorandum an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy. Teddy Roosevelt said we are a nation of immigrants. As such everybody is welcome from any race any country any religion if they want to be Americans. If they want to accept our values and our laws. If not they can stay where they are.
2016-01-28 00:00:00,kelly, Tonight we are coming to you live from the Iowa Event Center in downtown Des Moines in the shadow of the Iowa state capitol. In just four days people here in the Hawkeye State will caucus and cast the first votes of the 2016 election. Seven candidates are on that stage tonight their position on the stage determined by their standing in the latest national polls as well as polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. And here they are. Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Wow. So let's get started. Senator Cruz before we get to the issues let's address the elephant not in the room tonight. Donald Trump has chosen not to attend this evening's presidential debate. What message do you think that sends to the voters of Iowa? The divide between you and Mr. Trump has turned into one of the biggest stories in the country. And for six months that your campaign during this campaign you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel. You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican. But when he started to criticize you your message changed and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel and suggested he would do the Democrats' bidding. Which is it? Senator Christie you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle. However many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isn't great if you get the wrong things done. And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise. Why are they wrong and you're right? But first you can join tonight's conversation right from home. Go to google.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News debate to vote on which candidate you think has the best plan to defeat ISIS. We'll be right back. We have a lot we have a lot to cover. But we want to we want to turn the page to domestic... No no. No. No no no because we want to turn the page to domestic terror and let me tell you why: we're partnering with Google on this debate and they're telling us... ... that their search results have gone through the roof on on people... ... you're a good man Governor Kasich. People the search results the searches for terror issues for safety issues in America have gone through the roof increased over 400 percent since 2008. People are worried. They're worried about what's happening in the country and about a domestic terror attack as all of you know. Now when combating this threat Senator Rubio you've advocated closing down mosques we'll get back to you.Well you have advocated closing down closing down mosques diners any place where radicalization is occurring. You told me that. But the Supreme Court has made clear that hateful speech is generally protected by the First Amendment.In other words radical Muslims have the right to be radical Muslims unless they turn to terror. Doesn't your position run afoul of the First Amendment? Senator Paul do you agree with that? We're gonna close down mosques we're gonna close down diners where we think radical thinking's occurring? Governor Christie let's talk about profiling. In December... ... profiling. Profiling. In December two radical Muslims killed 14 people in San Bernardino California. Neighbors of the terrorists said that they did not report the couple to law enforcement prior to the crime because they were afraid that they would be accused of profiling. Now you have said that we should not profile. How do you square that with the San Bernardino case? They didn't know they were going to attack the country. That's not true. The neighbors said they saw men going in and out of the garage. They saw packages being delivered. They saw Muslims and they did not think that was enough to call the cops. Do you? Dr. Carson this week a female Muslim who served in the U.S. Air Force asked Hillary Clinton the question she asked whether the United States is still the best place in which to raise her three Muslim children. Given what she perceives as a rise in Islamaphobia in this country. Do you think the GOP messaging on Muslims has stoked the flames of bias on this as the Democrats suggest and how would you answer this veteran? Governor Kasich stand back. You appear to back in another debate a so-called back door to encrypted cell phone technology which protects most smartphones that we all have from hacking. And it includes our phones and it also protects the cell phones of the terrorist. Now the tech companies and a group of MIT scientists smart guys right warn that if they create a way for the FBI to have a back door into our encrypted communications then the bad guys will exploit it too. And they say that this is going to cause more security problems than it would solve for everyday Americans. Are they wrong? But this is public testimony. Governor thank you. Welcome back everybody. We are live in Des Moines Iowa. And let's get right back to the questions Bret. All right. We're going to move on. Because coming up immigration and something you've never seen before. Stay tuned right after this break. Welcome back everyone. Live in Des Moines Iowa. Now we move onto the topic of immigration. Senator Rubio we'll start with you. When you ran for Senate in 2010 you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants. You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S. Senator as well. Here are just a few examples. Watch. Within two years of getting elected you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship in your words amnesty. Haven't you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue? ... But you went on from there... ... You said more than that Senator... ... You said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. You... ... supported earned path to citizenship... Governor Bush do you agree Senator Rubio has not reversed himself on his immigration promise? Go ahead senator. All right. All right. This will be the last one. OK. Let's move on. Senator Cruz when Senator Rubio proposed that bill creating a path to citizenship you proposed an amendment. It would have allowed for legalization but not citizenship. Yes it would. Pressed last month on why you supported legalization you claimed that you didn't. Right? Like you just did. Saw that. You argued that this was just a poison pill amendment basically it's something designed to kill the bill and not actually get it through. But that is not however how it sounded at the time. Watch. Was that all an act? It was pretty convincing. But the bill allowed both. The bill you were amending allowed citizenship and legalization.
2016-01-28 00:00:00,bush, Bret we're just starting. The first vote hasn't been counted. Why don't we let the process work. I trust Iowans Granite staters people in South Carolina people in Nevada to start this process out. I kind of miss Donald Trump. He was a little teddy bear to me. We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets. I kind of miss him. I wish he was here. Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles believing in limited government believing in accountability. Leading by fixing the things that are broken.Look I am in the establishment because my dad the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president. Fine I'll take it. I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom. I'll take that too. But this election is not about our pedigree this is an election about people that are really hurting. We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it. And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November. Someone who has a proven record who has been tested who is totally transparent. I released 34 years of tax returns... ... and 300000 e-mails in my government record. To get the information from Hillary Clinton you need to get a subpoena from the FBI. No you weren't. Your name wasn't mentioned Ted. ... Chris keep it coming... ... Thank you Chris... Well first I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force. They should have made it more open ended for the next president. We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time. It became popular after the attack in Paris and San Bernardino. Now we hear the tough talk. Prior to that in the Reagan Library I gave a detailed plan. Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS. And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester we're going to have Islamic terrorism multi-generations of it all across this country. The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed which means we need to arm directly to Kurds imbed our troops with the Iraqi military re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders. Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all. Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees. But more importantly to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support... ... ground and air. That's what we need to to and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign. Of course. And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state local and federal level to do that. But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs. That's his first responsibility. Look we have waiting lists for veterans that are that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military. More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans and the waiting list grows. They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees including reducing the waiting lists without giving veterans care. People died and only three people have been fired.I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider. You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job give them give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result. And as it relates to all the other organizations let me give you a good example.In Houston Texas there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston. And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance. We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today. No they shouldn't. And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination. If I was a Puerto Rican I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship. They serve in the military. They would have to pay federal taxes. They would they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship. But they should have the right of determine self-determination. Before you get to that though Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face. You know it's it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates you move to Orlando.And a lot of people are doing that. And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms. The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that but they should not the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now. Well I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time. I mean that's a fact. And he asked me to support that. And I I supported him because I think people when you're elected you need to do things. And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for as Marco says for 30 years. And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives I guess.Here's what I believe. And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars. You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon. It's not a bestseller. I can promise you. There won't be any you can get it. It's affordable for everybody. We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally. It means come out from the shadows pay a fine earn legal status by working by paying taxes learning English. Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside. I think that is the I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem. So did you. Yeah. So did you Marco. Marco Marco he brought up my name. I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up. and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States. A bipartisan approach got close. Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then. And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight I supported it because you asked me to. I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems. There's never going do be perfect bill. But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support you shouldn't cut and run. You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened. He cut and run. And that's a tragedy because now... ... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
2016-01-28 00:00:00,cooper, Secretary Clinton what would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't? ...Thank you Senator... Senator... Senator Webb? Thanks sir. Senator Sanders let's talk about income inequality. Wages and incomes are flat. You've argued that the gap between rich and poor is wider than at any time since the 1920s. We've had a Democratic president for seven years. What are you going to be able to do that President Obama didn't? Secretary Clinton... I'll let you jump in a moment. Everybody will get in on this in a moment. Secretary Clinton how would you address this issue? In all candor you and your husband are part of the one percent. How can you credibly represent the views of the middle class? Governor O'Malley (inaudible). Just for viewers at home who may not be reading up on this Glass-Steagall is the Depression-era banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities. Secretary Clinton he raises a fundamental difference on this stage. Senator Sanders wants to break up the big Wall Street banks. You don't. You say charge the banks more continue to monitor them. Why is your plan better? Senator Sanders Secretary Clinton just said that her policy is tougher than yours. Why? Senator... Secretary Clinton you have to be able to respond. He brought you up.  Thank you. Thank you. Senator Sanders... Governor O'Malley? Where do you stand? Secretary Clinton... I have to let you respond. Thank you. Thank... Senator Sanders... Senator Sanders in 2008 congressional leaders were told without the 2008 bailout the U.S. was possibly days away from a complete meltdown. Despite that you still voted against it. As president would you stand by your principles if it risked the country's financial stability? We're going to talk about that in a minute. But Senator Webb I want to get you in. You have said neither party has the guts to take on Wall Street. Is the system rigged? You agreed to these rules and you're wasting time. So if you would finish your answer we'll move on. Governor Chafee you have attacked Secretary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street banks. In 1999 you voted for the very bill that made banks bigger. Are you saying you didn't know what you were voting for? Well with all due respect Governor... ... what does that say about you that you're casting a vote for something you weren't really sure about? Thank you Governor. I want to bring in Dana Bash. Dana? Senator Sanders I want to bring it over to Juan Carlos Lopez from CNN en Espanol. We're obviously in Nevada. It's had the highest percentage of undocumented immigrants of any state in the country as of last year. Juan Carlos? Senator Webb... ...Thank you Senator. Secretary Clinton? ...Secretary... Secretary Clinton let me ask you. Two of your rivals from your left Governor O'Malley and Senator Sanders want to provide instate college tuition to undocumented immigrants. Where do you stand on that? So on the record you believe that undocumented immigrants should get instate college tuition. Governor O'Malley? ...Senator... Senator Sanders you talked about your record on the Veteran affairs committee. You served on that committee for the last eight years including two years as its chairman while veterans died waiting for health care. You and Senator McCain ultimately addressed the issue with bi-partisan legislation. Why did it take 18 Inspector General reports and a CNN investigation and others before you and your colleagues took action? Governor Chafee you and Hillary Clinton both voted for the Patriot Act which created the NSA surveillance program. You've emphasized civil liberties privacy during your campaign. Aren't these two things in conflict? Do you regret that vote? Secretary Clinton do you regret your vote on the Patriot Act? Senator Senator Sanders you're the only one on this stage who voted against the Patriot Act in 2001... ... and the reauthorization votes. Let me ask you if elected would you shut down the NSA surveillance program? Would you shut down the NSA surveillance program? You would point blank. Governor Chafee Edward Snowden is he a traitor or a hero? Bring him home no jail time? Secretary Clinton hero or traitor? Should he do jail time? ClINTON: In addition in addition he stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands. So I don't think he should be brought home without facing the music. Governor O'Malley Snowden? Senator Sanders Edward Snowden? Is he a hero? Senator Webb Edward Snowden? Another another question for each of you starting with Governor Chafee. Name the one thing the one way that your administration would not be a third term of President Obama. President Obama's generals right now are suggesting keeping troops in Afghanistan after the time he wanted them pulled out. Would you keep them there? Governor O'Malley how would you be different than President Obama's administration? Secretary Clinton how would you not be a third term of President Obama? Is there a policy difference? Senator Sanders? Senator Webb how would you not be a third term for Obama? Senator Sanders he cited you. You don't hear a lot of Democratic presidential candidates talking about revolution. What do you mean? And we want to and we're going to talk more about climate change and environmental issues coming up. Some of the candidates have tried marijuana as have pretty much probably everybody in this room. (LAUGHTER) Others have not. Does that influence does it influence their views on legalization? Find out that and others ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) And welcome back to this CNN Democratic presidential debate. It has been quite a night so far. We are in the final block of this debate. All the candidates are back which I'm very happy to see. (LAUGHTER) It's a long story. Let's continue shall we? Secretary Clinton welcome back. That's right. Secretary Clinton Governor O'Malley says the presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth between two royal families. This year has been the year of the outsider in politics just ask Bernie Sanders. Why should Democrats embrace an insider like yourself? Governor O'Malley do you want to tell Secretary Clinton why she shouldn't get the crown? Secretary Clinton you have to be able to respond if you want. (inaudible). Senator Sanders does she have the right stuff? we've got we a lot of questions we've got about climate change and we're gonna go to Don Lemon. Don? Governor... ...Governor O'Malley thank you very much. Senator Webb you have a very different view than just about anybody else on this stage and unlike a lot of Democrats. You're pro-coal you're pro-offshore drilling you're pro-Keystone pipeline. Are again are you the question is are you out of step with the Democratic party? Senator Sanders are you tougher on on climate change than Secretary Clinton? Senator thank you Senator. Secretary Clinton I want you to be able to respond then I'm gonna go to (ph) (inaudible). Thank you. Dana Bash?
2016-01-28 00:00:00,o'malley," Yes. Anderson I want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from Vermont mentioned and I actually did them in our state. We raised the minimum wage passed the living wage invested more in infrastructure went four years in a row without a penny's increase in college tuition. But there's another piece that Senator Sanders left out tonight but he's been excellent about underscoring that. And that is that we need to separate the casino speculative mega-bank gambling that we have to insure with our money from the commercial banking namely reinstating Glass-Steagall. Secretary Clinton mentioned my support eight years ago. And Secretary I was proud to support you eight years ago but something happened in between and that is Anderson a Wall Street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families. And we are still just as vulnerable Paul Volcker says today. We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall and that's a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates. Anderson look this is the big banks I mean once we repealed Glass-Steagall back in the late 1999s (ph) the big banks the six of them went from controlling what the equivalent of 15 percent of our GDP to now 65 percent of our GDP. And (inaudible) right before this debate Secretary Clinton's campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things. But one of them that we still have a great difference on Madam Secretary is that you are not for Glass-Steagall. You are not for putting a firewall between this speculative risky shadow banking behavior. I am and the people of our country need a president who's on their side willing to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street. We have to fulfill... ...our promise. And Juan Carlos Juan Carlos... Juan Carlos I think what you've heard up here is some of the old thinking on immigration reform and that's why it's gridlocked. We need to understand that our country is stronger in every generation by the arrival of new American immigrants. That is why I have put out a policy for comprehensive immigration reform that is why I would go further than President Obama has on DACA and DAPA. I mean we are a nation of immigrants we are made stronger by immigrants. Do you think for a second that simply because somebody's standing in a broken que on naturalization they're not going to go to the hospital and that care isn't going to fall on to our insurance rates? I am for a generous compassionate America that says we're all in this together. We need comprehensive ...immigration reform. It'll make wages go up in America $250 for every year... Here. Here. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) Anderson we actually did this in my state of Maryland. We passed... We passed a state version of the DREAM Act... (CHEERING) ...And a lot of the xenophobes the immigrant haters like some that we've heard like Donald Trump that carnival barker in the Republican party... (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) Tried to mischaracterize it as free tuition for illegal immigrants. But we took our case to the people when it was petitioned to referendum and we won with 58 percent of the vote. The more our children learn the more they will earn and that's true of children who have yet to be naturalized... ...but will become American citizens... Anderson Snowden put a lot of Americans' lives at risk. Snowden broke the law. Whistleblowers do not run to Russia and try to get protection from Putin. If he really believes that he should be back here. I would follow through on the promise that the American people thought we made as Democratic Party to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street. I would push to separate out these too-big-to-jail too-big-to-fail banks and put in place Glass-Steagall a modern Glass-Steagall that creates a firewall so that this wreckage of our economy can never happen again. Anderson I actually have talked about a revolution. What we need is a green energy revolution. We need to move America to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way. Well actually you know we had this conversation. And I will share with you that I've traveled all around the country Anderson and there's two phrases I keep hearing again and again and again. And they're the phrases ""new leadership"" and ""getting things done."" We cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago and think that a resort to old names is going to move us forward. I respect what Secretary Clinton and her husband have done for our country. But our country needs new leadership to move forward. Yeah. Anna I have put forward a plan and I'm the only candidate I believe in either party to do this to move America forward to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. We did not land a man on the moon with an all-of-the-above strategy. It was an intentional engineering challenge and we solved it as a nation. And our nation must solve this one. So I put forward the plan that would extend the investor tax credits for solar and for wind. If you go across Iowa you see that 30 percent of their energy now comes from wind. We're here in Las Vegas one of the most sustainable cities in America doing important things in terms of green building architecture and design. We can get there as a nation but it's going to require presidential leadership. And as president I intend to sign as my very first order in office the an order that moves us as a nation and dedicates our resources to solving this problem and moving us to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. We can do it."
2016-01-28 00:00:00,kasich, Well first of all I had a national reporter say you know there's three lanes. There's the establishment lane the anti-establishment lane and then there's the Kasich lane. And the reason is is that I've been a reformer all of my career fighting to reform welfare fighting to reform the Pentagon also being in a position to balance the budget because that is very very hard to do.And then in Ohio of course I had to bring about big reform again because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400000 jobs since I took over as governor. You know the situation is this. We cannot fix things in this country the Social Security the border balancing the budget getting wages to grow faster unless we lead as conservatives but we also invite people in from the other party. We have to come together as a country. And we have to stop all the divisions.And you know that's been my message in New Hampshire. And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa but in New Hampshire I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive they see unity they see coming together and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.And it isn't because I'm all that great. It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves. I'll keep I'll keep heading in that direction believe me. Chris... ... there was a question about foreign policy by the way and experience. And I I thought if I didn't jump in I might not be able to tell everybody this. I think they'd want to hear it. Look I served on... ... but wait a minute... ...the only reason is look... OK. I've always listened to you Megyn. Go ahead. Yes thank you. Well look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools. And those are made up of the FBI state and local law enforcement. And Megyn it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption it will get solved but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks. But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said. Now I want to go back something. See I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military. I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong. And I was there when we went into the Gulf War. We didn't win that war just from the air we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America. We want to destroy ISIS it has to be in the air and on the ground. It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.And then when we win that and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down and we should leave. Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world. But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that. But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them the Arabs the Jordanians the Saudis the Egyptians our friends in Europe including the Turks. So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together. I saw Reagan do it I've seen other presidents do it. And frankly if you want to be commander in chief you have to have the experience. At the same time we're doing all that the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform. All of that together we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world. Well you've got to be on top of it right away. And you know I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done. I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable. But the fact is every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that. And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move whether it's storms whether it was a horrible school shooting. There are many crises that come a water crisis in Toledo. You've got to be on top of it. You've got to go the extra mile. You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.Because you realize that people depending on you. And so you go the extra mile. But people have to be alert. They have to be alert to problems. And when you see a problem you must act quickly to get on top of it. And people at home are saying they've got a problem listen to them. Because most of the time they're absolutely correct.So the fact is that we work for the people. The people don't work for us. And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood. That's what really matters. We serve you. You don't serve us. We listen to you and and then we act.
2016-01-28 00:00:00,cruz," Well Megyn let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year. By Monday you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa. You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches. You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls Caroline and Catherine into your homes. And I'm so grateful for the diligence for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.If I am elected president keep an eye on the tarmac because I'll be back because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country. It will be fly-to country. Now secondly let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid fat and ugly. And Ben you're a terrible surgeon. Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way... I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief. Well let me be clear if Donald engages in insults or anybody else I don't intend to reciprocate. I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to. I am glad Donald is running. I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm and every Donald Trump voter or potential voter I hope to earn your support. I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.Now there is a difference between personal insults and attacks between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance. CRUZ: I think issues and substance policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics. That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus. That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward. Well I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition. You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and stitch together a winning majority. When it comes to the audit the Fed bill as Rand knows well I was an original sponsor of the bill I'm strongly supportive of it. It didn't have the votes to pass. And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve. Well Chris I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism go after ISIS hunt them down wherever they are and utterly and completely destroy ISIS. You know you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing. It is not tough talk. It is a different fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama. Barack Obama right now number one over seven years has dramatically degraded our military. You know just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war. When that war began we had 8000 planes. Today we have about 4000. When that war began we had 529 ships. Today we have 272.You want to know what carpet bombing is? It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1100 air attacks a day saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy. Right now Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. He's not arming the Kurds. We need to define the enemy. We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy. And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs. Chris in 1981 when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness undermined our ability to defend this country so too has Barack Obama. Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven so it had then. What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system. It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military. I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism ... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy rebuilding our Air Force rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe. Chris? Chris I was mentioned in that question. ... Actually I was... ... Chris your questions that you... ... What was your question... ... Your question was you have disagreed... ... opening statement. ... This entire question was an attack but that's Chris I would note that that the last four questions have been ""Rand please attack Ted. Marco please attack Ted. Chris please attack Ted. Jeb please attack Ted..."" Let me just say this... ... Well no no. A debate actually is a policy issue but I will say this. Gosh if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage. Chris the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief. Who has the experience who has the knowledge who has the judgement who has the clarity and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe. That is what this debate is all about and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues rather than just attacks directed at each other. Sure. Well let's take it one at a time. First of all we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster. It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs have been forced into part-time work have lost their health insurance have lost their doctors have seen their premiums skyrocket. If I'm elected president we will repeal every word of Obamacare. Now once that is done everyone agrees we need healthcare reform. It should follow the principles of expanding competition empowering patients and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.Three specific reforms that reflect those principles. Number one we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines. That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost catastrophic health insurance.Number two we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs. And number three we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job your health insurance goes with you and it is personal portable and affordable.And I'll tell you Bret I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt. I want this bill to be voted down. I don't want immigration reform to fail. I want immigration reform to pass. I believe if this amendment were to pass the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically. I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted that the bill would pass. And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics not to campaigning all the time but to actually fixing this problem to finding a middle ground. That would fix the problem and also allow for those 11 million people who are here illegally a legal status with citizenship off the table. You know the amendment you're talking about is one sentence it's 38 words. Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said. In those 38 words it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship. It didn't say a word about legalization. I introduced... But but Megyn the bill was 1000 pages. I introduced a series of amendments each designed to fix problems in the bill. The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill. And I'll tell you who supported my amendment Jeff Sessions the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress. And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill who were looking for votes.Listen we can solve immigration. We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration. I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website tedcruz.org. It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions and... ... we have the tools in federal law to do this now. We can build the fence. We can triple the border patrol. We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off... ... funding to them. We can end welfare for those here illegally. And what is missing is the political will because too many Democrats and sadlyaction. Black lives matter and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system and to address race relations in our country."
2016-01-28 00:00:00,clinton," Well I think that President Obama has been a great moral leader on these issues and has laid out an agenda that has been obstructed by the Republicans at every turn so... ...So what we need to be doing is not only reforming criminal justice I have talked about that at some length including things like body cameras but we also need to be following the recommendations of the commissioner that President Obama empanelled on policing. There is an agenda there that we need to be following up on. Similarly we need to tackle mass incarceration and this may be the only bi-partisan issue in the congress this year. We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world. But I believe that the debate and the discussion has to go further Anderson because we've got to do more about the lives of these children. That's why I started off by saying we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential. That is... ...really hard to do if you don't have early childhood education... ...if you don't have schools that are able to meet the needs of the people or good housing there's a long list... ...We need a new New Deal for communities of color... Well you know both Bill and I have been very blessed. Neither of us came from wealthy families and we've worked really hard our entire lives. And I want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and I have had to make the most of their God-given potential and to have the chances that they should have in America for a good education good job training and then good jobs. I have a five point economic plan because this inequality challenge we face we have faced it at other points. It's absolutely right. It hasn't been this bad since the 1920s. But if you look at the Republicans versus the Democrats when it comes to economic policy there is no comparison. The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that's why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017. Well my plan is more comprehensive. And frankly it's tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail. We can never let the American taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw. But we also have to worry about some of the other players AIG a big insurance company; Lehman Brothers an investment bank. There's this whole area called ""shadow banking."" That's where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from. So I'm with both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks. And the plan that I have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk. But I want to make sure we're going to cover everybody not what caused the problem last time but what could cause it next time. Yeah. You know I I respect the passion an intensity. I represented Wall Street as a senator from New York and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 before the big crash that we had and I basically said ""cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors."" I took on the Bush administration for the same thing. So I have thought deeply and long about what we're gonna do to do exactly what I think both the senator and the governor want which is to rein in and stop this risk. And my plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail. Nobody went to jail after $100 billion in fines were paid... ...and would give regulators the authority to go after the big banks. But I'm telling you I will say it tonight. If only you look at the big banks you may be missing the forest for the trees. So... ...no that's not what... ...that I think Dodd-Frank was a very... ...good start and I think that we have to implement it. We have to prevent the Republicans from ripping it apart. We have to save the Consumer Financial Protection board which is finally beginning to act to protect consumers. We have work to do. You've got no argument from me. But I know if we don't come in with a very tough and comprehensive approach like the plan I'm recommending we're gonna be behind instead of ahead... ...on what the next crisis could be. Well you know everybody on this stage has changed a position or two. We've been around a cumulative quite some period of time. You know we know that if you are learning you're gonna change your position. I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone. But I have been on the forefront of dealing with climate change starting in 2009 when President Obama and I crashed (ph) a meeting with the Chinese and got them to sign up to the first international agreement to combat climate change that they'd ever joined. So I'm... ...not taking a back seat to anybody on my values... ...my principles and the results that I get. Well let me address college affordability because I have a plan that I think will really zero in on what the problems are. First all the 40 million Americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate. That will save thousands of dollars for people who are now struggling under this cumbersome burdensome college debt. As a young student in Nevada said to me the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it. So then we have to make it more affordable. How do we make it more affordable? My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free. You would not have to borrow money for tuition. But I do believe and maybe it's because I worked when I went through college; I worked when I went through law school I think it's important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished. That's why I call it a compact. But yes I would like students to work 10 hours a week... Well I fully support Social Security. And the most important fight we're going to have is defending it against continuing Republican efforts to privatize it. I want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of Social Security. We have a lot of women on Social Security particularly widowed and single women who didn't make a lot of money during their careers and they are impoverished and they need more help from the Social Security system. And I will focus I will focus on helping those people who need it the most. And of course I'm going to defend Social Security. I'm going to look for ways to try to make sure it's solvent into the future. And we also need to talk about health care at some time because we agree on the goals we just disagree on the means. Well first of all I want to make sure every child gets health care. That's why I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program and I want to support states that are expanding health care and including undocumented children and others. I want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy in to the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. I think to go beyond that as I understand what Governor O'Malley has recommended so that they would get the same subsidies. I think that is it raises so many issues. It would be very difficult to administer it needs to be part of a comprehensive immigration reform when we finally do get to it. I want to follow up because I think underneath Juan Carlos' important questions there is such a difference between everything you're hearing here on this stage and what we hear from the Republicans. Demonize hard-working immigrants who have insulted them. You know I came to Las Vegas in I think May. Early may. Met with a group of DREAMers I wish everybody in America could meet with this young people to hear their stories to know their incredible talent their determination and that's why I would go further... ...than even the executive orders that President Obama has signed when I'm president. (CROSS TALK) My plan would support any state that takes that position and would work with those states and encourage more states to do the same thing. If their states agree then we want more states to do the same thing. No I don't. I think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9/11 to put in place the security that we needed. And it is true that it did require that there be a process. What happened however is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process. And I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in. We always have to keep the balance of civil liberties privacy and security. It's not easy in a democracy but we have to keep it in mind. He broke the laws of the United States. He could have been a whistleblower. He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower. He could have raised all the issues that he has raised. And I think there would have been a positive response to that. Well I think that's pretty obvious. I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we've had up until this point including President Obama. Well there's a lot that I would like to do to build on the successes of President Obama but also as I'm laying out to go beyond. And that's in my economic plans how I would deal with the prescription drug companies how I would deal with college how I would deal with a full range of issues that I've been talking about throughout this campaign to go further. Well thank you. (LAUGHTER) You know it does take me a little longer. That's all I can say. Well I can't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president but I'm not just running because I would be the first woman president. I'm running because I have a lifetime of experience in getting results and fighting for people fighting for kids for women for families fighting to even the odds. And I know what it takes to get things done. I know how to find common ground and I know how to stand my ground. And I think we're going to need both of those in Washington to get anything that we're talking about up here accomplished. So I'm very happy that I have both the commitment of a lifetime and the experience of a lifetime to bring together to offer the American people. Well I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name. I would ask them to listen to what I'm proposing look at what I've accomplished in the Senate as secretary of of state and then draw your own conclusion. I certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is Clinton. I'm campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what the country needs at this point and I think I can take the fight to the Republicans because we cannot afford a Republican to succeed Barack Obama as president of the United States. Well that that's exactly what I've been doing. When we met in Copenhagen in 2009 and literally President Obama and I were hunting for the Chinese going throughout this huge convention center because we knew we had to get them to agree to something. Because there will be no effective efforts against climate change unless China and India join with the rest of the world. They told us they'd left for the airport; we found out they were having a secret meeting. We marched up we broke in we said ""We've been looking all over for you. Let's sit down and talk about what we need to do."" And we did come up with the first international agreement that China has signed. Thanks to President Obama's leadership it's now gone much further. And I do think that the bilateral agreement that President Obama made with the Chinese was significant. Now it needs to go further and there will be an international meeting at the end of this year and we must get verifiable commitments to fight climate change from every country gathered there."
2016-01-28 00:00:00,lemon, All right. This one is for Martin O'Malley. Anderson Governor O'Malley this is from Anna Bettis from Tempe Arizona. Here it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION: As a young person I'm very concerned about climate change and how it will affect my future. As a presidential candidate what will you do to address climate change? (END VIDEO CLIP) So Governor O'Malley please tell Anna how you would protect the environment better than all the other candidates up on that stage.
2016-01-28 00:00:00,lopez, Gracias Anderson. Senator Sanders in 2013 you voted for immigration reform. But in 2007 when Democrats controlled Congress and the Bush White House was onboard you voted against it. Why should Latino voters trust you now when you left them at the altar at the moment when reform was very close? Tom Harkin isn't running for president. You are. Secretary Clinton Secretary Clinton Governor O'Malley wants to open up Obamacare to millions of undocumented immigrants and their children including almost 90000 people right here in Nevada. Do you? Governor O'Malley? Senator Webb do you support the undocumented immigrants getting Obamacare? ...Thank you Senator.
2016-01-28 00:00:00,paul," You know I've always had a great deal of respect. There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father. I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation. And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country. I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.You know Ted didn't show up. We had an audit-the-Fed vote which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for for 30 years Ted didn't have time to show up. He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household. I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.The NSA is another big issue. Ted said he was for NSA reform but then he told Marco Rubio no no no I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.I don't think Ted can have it both ways. They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote. But we don't see it happening at all. We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote. May I respond? Well I mean I was talked about in the question. Just very quickly I would like to respond. The bulk collection of your phone data the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack. I don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.When we look at this bulk collection the court has looked at this. Even the court declared it to be illegal. If we want to collect the records of terrorists let's do it the old fashioned way. Let's use the Fourth Amendment. Let's put a name on a warrant let's ask a judge for it. Let's respect the history of our country.John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants. Let's don't forget that. My budget was mentioned. My budget was mentioned. ... Senator Cruz I'd like to respond... ... and I'd like to respond. Thank you Marco. Thank you. The issue in Syria's a very important one and it's one we need to get right. The question is should we be bombing both sides of the war? Some want to topple Assad. In fact they want to bomb ISIS and Assad simultaneously.I think that's a really really bad idea. In fact I've said for several years that arming the allies of ISIS will make the situation worse That what we really need to do is defeat ISIS.But if you defeat Assad what you will wind up with is a larger and more powerful ISIS that occupies that space. You might you may well see an ISIS that takes over all of Syria. . Yeah no I think that's a that's a huge mistake to be closing down mosques. But I would say that if you want to defend the country it begins with border security. And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio. When he brought forward the ""Gang of Eight"" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students those who are coming as immigrants those who are coming as refugees because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.Marco opposed this because they made a deal. He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments. And I think that's a mistake and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways. You can't be in favor of defend us... ... against Islam radical Islam if you're not for border security. You know I've supported legislation to allow body cameras. I've been to Ferguson I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem. One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines. People were just being fined to death. Now you and I and many of the people in this audience if we get a $100 fine we can survive it. If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed a lot of times you lose your job.I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.In Ferguson for every 100 African-American women there are only 60 African-American men. Drug use is about equal between white and black but our prisons three out of four people in prison are black or brown. I think something has to change. I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform."
2016-01-28 00:00:00,bash, Thank you. CNN visited college campuses along with Facebook. And not surprisingly college affordability was among the most pressing issue. Senator Sanders you've mentioned a couple of times you do have a plan to make public colleges free for everyone. Secretary Clinton has criticized that in saying she's not in favor of making a college free for Donald Trump's kids. Do you think taxpayers should pick up the tab for wealthy children? And Secretary Clinton it's not just college tuition that Senator Sanders is talking about expanding Social Security and giving all Americans Medicare. What's wrong with that? Secretary Clinton... Can you answer the... Secretary Clinton the question was not just about tuition though. It was about Senator Sanders' plan to expand Social Security to make Medicare available to all Americans. Is that something that you would support? And if not why not? Do you want to expand it?

2016-01-14 00:00:00,bartiromo," Tonight we are working with Facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered. And according to Facebook the U.S. election has dominated the global conversation with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race. That makes it the number one issue talked about on Facebook last year worldwide. Tonight's rules are simple: up to 90 seconds for each answer one minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time you'll hear this. So let's get started. Candidates jobs and growth two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week the president said quote ""we have the strongest most durable economy in the world."" And according to our Facebook research jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.The president said that anyone who claims America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Senator Cruz what do you see that he doesn't? Thank you sir. We know that recent global events have many people worried Iran detaining American sailors forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate not to mention ISIS is getting stronger. Governor Christie sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order? Just to be clear Governor where and when would you use military action? Dr. Carson the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders? Senator Cruz the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race your campaign said ""it was inadvertent."" A million dollars is inadvertent? Thank you. Thank you senator. Mr. Trump South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address... ...appeared to choose sides within the party saying Republicans should resist quote ""the siren call of the angriest voices"". She confirmed she was referring to you among others. Was she out of line? And how would a President Trump unite the party? But what are you going to do about it? Governor Kasich... ... Governor Kasich Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders. He's now at 41 percent in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Vice President Biden sang his praises saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real and he has credibility on it. So what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a self-avowed socialist and who doesn't think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee? Dr. Carson one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clinton's past indiscretions. Is that a legitimate topic in this election? And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct? Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates right here in North Charleston. Let's get right back to the questions. Governor Bush gun rights one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston Dylann Roof who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns but those who sell them? Thank you sir. Mr. Trump are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America? Thank you sir. Thank you sir. So what is the answer Senator Cruz to stop mass shootings and violent crime up in 30 cities across the country? Senator... ... let me follow up and switch gears. Senator Cruz you suggested Mr. Trump quote ""embodies New York values."" Could you explain what you mean by that? I am from New York. I don't. Are you sure about that? There's much more ahead including the fight against ISIS. More from Charleston South Carolina when we come right back. We welcome back to the Republican Presidential  right back to the questions. Candidates the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience. He says ""the air-strike now in their 16th month have been ineffective."" Dr. Carson ... The air-strikes. Now in their 16th month are ineffective. Dr. Carson do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20000 troops ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS? Thank you sir. Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And I quote ""The now king of Saudi Arabia told us 'you can have our army you just got to deal with Assad.' ""The emir of Qatar said 'I'll pay for the operation but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians. Assad has to go.'""Governor Christie how imp x Business Network. I'm Neil Cavuto alongside my friend and co-moderator Maria Bartiromo.

2016-01-14 00:00:00,trump, It's not fear and terror it's reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia bombings all over. You look at California you look frankly at Paris where there's a the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. They're very very badly wounded. They will some will follow. And you look around and you see what's happening and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor very nice everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.That could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great great destruction. When I look at the migration I looked at the line I said it actually on your show recently where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong powerful men young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on? You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married they were radicalized they got married they killed 15 people in actually 15 going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look a good strong look and that's what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can't do it. But I was born here. . Big difference. OK good. Because it wouldn't work. ... first of all let me just tell you something and you know because you just saw the numbers yourself NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll headline: Trump way up Cruz going down. I mean so don't so you can't you can't... ...they don't like the Wall Street Journal. They don't like NBC but I like the poll. And frankly it just came out and in Iowa now as you know Ted in the last three polls I'm beating you. So you know you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls. You don't have to say that. In fact I was all for you until you started doing that because that's a misrepresentation number one. Number two this isn't me saying it. I don't care. I think I'm going to win fair and square to win this way. Thank you. Lawrence Tribe and from Harvard of Harvard said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. OK? There are other attorneys that feel and very very fine constitutional attorneys that feel that because he was not born on the land he cannot run for office. Here's the problem. We're running. We're running. He does great. I win. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride. I don't like that. OK? The fact is and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field he beats the rest of the field . See they don't like that. They don't like that. No they don't like he beats the rest of the field because they want me. But if for some reason Neil he beats the rest of the field I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running. And if you become the nominee who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out get a declaratory judgment let the courts decide. And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much... Because now he's going a little bit better. No I didn't care . It's true. No it's true. Hey look he never had a chance. Now he's doing better. He's got probably a four or five percent chance. The fact is there is a big overhang. There's a big question mark on your head. And you can't do that to the party. You really can't. You can't do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance and it's far greater than one percent because . I mean you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run. If there was a and you know I'm not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit and you have to have certainty. You can't have a question. I can agree with you or not but you can't have a question over your head. You don't have to. Take it from Lawrence Tribe. Take it from your professors... He's wrong. He's wrong. He is not the only one. There are many lawyers. No no... ... I think if it doesn't... I like that. I like it. I'd consider it. But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out. I have a feeling it's going to work out actually. Okay. First of all Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers. Actually a close friend. And wherever you are sitting Nikki I'm a friend. We're friends. That's good. But she did say there was anger. And I could say oh I'm not angry. I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare we're going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes I am angry. And I won't be angry when we fix it but until we fix it I'm very very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that I wasn't offended. She said the truth. One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said well she said you were angry and I said to myself huh she's right. I'm not fighting that. I didn't find it offensive at all. I'm angry because our country is a mess. No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now. If even in Paris if they had guns on the other side going in the opposite direction you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.We have a huge mental health problem in this country. We're closing hospitals we're closing wards we're closing so many because the states want to save money. We have to get back into looking at what's causing it. The guns don't pull the trigger. It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on. We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. He doesn't want to get people together the old-fashioned way where you get Congress. You get the Congress you get the Senate you get together you do legislation. He just writes out an executive order. Not supposed to happen that way. You get the Congress. You get the Senate. You get together. You do legislation. He just writes out an order executive order. It's not supposed to happen that way. So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan including William F. Buckley and others just so you understand. And just so if I could because he insulted a lot of people. I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made New York is a great place. It's got great people it's got loving people wonderful people. When the World Trade Center came down I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully more humanely than New York. You had two one hundred... ...you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed and the cleanup started the next day and it was the most horrific cleanup probably in the history of doing this and in construction. I was down there and I've never seen anything like it. And the people in New York fought and fought and fought and we saw more death and even the smell of death nobody understood it. And it was with us for months the smell the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you that was a very insulting statement that Ted made. It's not fear and terror it's reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia bombings all over. You look at California you look frankly at Paris where there's a the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.

2016-01-14 00:00:00,unknown, : Not me. : Not me.
2016-01-14 00:00:00,christie, Well Maria I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world. Because Tuesday night I watched story time with Barack Obama. And I've got to tell you it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing you know? The fact is there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word. Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word in a Christie administration they know we're going to keep it. Next we have to talk to our adversaries and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president given what Ted said right at the beginning he's absolutely right. It's a it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.The president doesn't understand and by the way neither does Secretary Clinton and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. If you're worried about the world being on fire you're worried about how we're going to use our military you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.I will not do that. If I'm the nominee she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. MIlitary action Maria would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. We are not the world's policeman but we need to stand up and be ready. And the problem Maria is that the military is not ready either. We need to rebuild our military and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful and in a Christie administration they would know much much better than to do that. I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly look at Governor Bush and say someone told you that because we're running for the same office that criticizing me will get you to that office. It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too. So the indignation that you carry on some of the stuff you have to also own then. So let's set the facts straight. First of all I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.Third if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.And on Common Core Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when you're a senator what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.When you're a governor you're held accountable for everything you do. And the people of New Jersey I've seen it. And the last piece is this. I like Marco too and two years ago he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed. That was before he was running against me. Now that he is he's changed his tune. I'm never going to change my tune. I like Marco Rubio. He's a good guy a smart guy and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be. No absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress without working with the legislature and without getting the consent of the American people. And the fact is that that's not a democracy. That's a dictatorship. And we need to very very concerned about that. See here's the thing. I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important. The fact is in New Jersey what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that not harder. And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action not by signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child. That's what he is. I mean you know... ... the fact is Neil let's think about let's think about and I want to maybe I hope the president is watching tonight because here's what I'd like to tell him.Mr. President we're not against you. We're against your policies. When you became president you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it. That's not right. It's not constitutional. And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall. Well Maria I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world. Because Tuesday night I watched story time with Barack Obama. And I've got to tell you it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing you know? The fact is there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word. Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word in a Christie administration they know we're going to keep it. Next we have to talk to our adversaries and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president given what Ted said right at the beginning he's absolutely right. It's a it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.The president doesn't understand and by the way neither does Secretary Clinton and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.

2016-01-14 00:00:00,rubio," Yeah I would go first of all one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldn't just be a disaster Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States. Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever. On the issue of Barack Obama Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists and it is a war that they win or we win.When I'm president of the United States we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay Cuba and we are going to find out everything they know. Let me . I was invoked in that question so let me just say in that answer let me say the real question here I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV. But the real but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. OK? Listen we this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008 we elected a president that didn't want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when I'm president we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When I'm president we're going to have a president that acts like it. You know as I said already twice in this  we have a very serious problem in this country. We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of... Well I am going to answer your question Neil. He is this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. This president is undermining our military. He is undermining our standing in the world. I like Chris Christie but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core. We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. This president this president is more interested in funding less interested in funding the military than he is in funding planned he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military. Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. Let me tell you if we don't get this election right there may be no turning back for America. We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.So I just truly with all my heart belief I like everybody on the stage. No one is a socialist. No one here is under FBI investigation. So we have a good group of people. Our next president... Unfortunately Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Our next president and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions. That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away. Look the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America he would. I am convinced that this president if he could get rid of the Second Amendment he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general not to defend the Second Amendment but to figure out ways to undermine it.I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment but to figure out ways to undermine it.Here's my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show. They don't buy their guns from a collector. And they don't buy their guns from a gun store. They get they steal them. They get them on the black market.And let me tell you ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show. These... ... his answer you name it. If there's an act of violence in America his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Here's a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.When I'm president of the United States we are defending the Second Amendment not undermining it the way Barack Obama does. About every two weeks he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns. He has never defended... ...I'll give you a fact. Well let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States and he was a candidate and he went and said ""These Americans with traditional values they are bitter people and they cling to their guns and to their religion."" That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this. This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment. He doesn't meet here's the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House it's not ""how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."" It's ""give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."" That will never happen when I am president of the United States. Yeah I would go first of all one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldn't just be a disaster Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States. Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.

2016-01-14 00:00:00,carson," Well I'm very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came. You know I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And you know we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.I mean just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.But here's the real key. We have the world's best military even though he's done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back they can get it accomplished. Neil I was mentioned too. Yeah he said everybody. And and I just want to take this opportunity to say you know in the 2012 election you know we and when I say we Republicans tore themselves apart.You know we have to stop this because you know if we manage to damage ourselves and we lose the next election and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks this nation is over as we know it. And we got to look at the big picture here. Well there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. But you know here's the real issue is this America anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles? You know you look at what's going on you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. You know we have a war on virtual everything race wars gender wars income wars religious wars age wars. Every war you can imaging we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.You know you go to the internet you start reading an article and you go to the comments section you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots I can tell you that. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. They've been beaten into submission. It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in. Wait a minute who in their 16th month? OK. Well there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is. I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission so we need to take that away from them.The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them ""what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?""Our decision is then do we give them what we need. I say yes not only do we give them what they need but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done. In addition to that... ...in addition to that we go ahead and we take the oil from them their source of revenue. You know some of these these engagement rules that the administration has ""we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it"" give me a break.Just tell them that you put people in there we're going to bomb them. So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed. You know that's so simple. And then we need to shut down we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers. Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?We know to go ahead and shut off the supply routes and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go. They should be running all the time then they won't have time to plan attacks against us. Well I'm very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came. You know I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.

2016-01-14 00:00:00,bush, Well first of all the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder. Think about it. With grandiose language the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40000 battle-tested terrorists. He's missing the whole point that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina a Medal of Honor recipient. I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration every weapon system has been gutted in this administration the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us and we're in a much difficult we're in a much different position than we should be.And for the life of me I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run China Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed and we pull back.As president of the United States I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force not to be the world's policeman but to make sure that in a peaceful world people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies. No. And worse worse yet to be honest with you Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster. Think about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran Benghazi the Russian reset Dodd-Frank all the things that have that have gone wrong in this country she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong.And you know what? Here's the problem. If she gets elected she's under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected her first 100 days instead of setting an agenda she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. Neil my name was mentioned here. Neil my name was mentioned as well. Here's the deal Chris is totally right. He's been a good governor and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton. And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process as wild and woolly as it's going to be this is not being bad.These attack ads are going to be part of life. Everybody just needs to get used to it. Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton because she is a disaster. Our country rise up again but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people that unites us around our common purpose.And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads and discount the the back-and-forth here because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton. First of all I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the the Emanuel AME church killings. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed. I don't know if any of us could have done what they did one after another within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. Look here's the deal in this particular case the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do. We don't need to add new rules we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person should not have gotten a gun should not would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.That's what they do whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn't law-abiding gun owners.Look I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida if you commit a crime with a gun you're going away. You're going away for a long long while.And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns and if you do that and get it right you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide. The other issue is mental health. That's a serious issue that we could work on. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this. The president's first impulse is do this by executive order power he doesn't have. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns. Well first of all under President Jeb Bush we would restore the strength of the military. Last week Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again. It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm. The deployments are too high for the military personnel. We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. We're gutting our military and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.We have to eliminate the sequester rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.Secondly as it relates to Iran we need to confront their ambitions across the board. We should reimpose sanctions they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles. Thirdly we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel... ...and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority. We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations. The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country. Well first of all the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder. Think about it. With grandiose language the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40000 battle-tested terrorists. He's missing the whole point that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina a Medal of Honor recipient. I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration every weapon system has been gutted in this administration the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us and we're in a much difficult we're in a much different position than we should be.And for the life of me I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run China Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed and we pull back.As president of the United States I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force not to be the world's policeman but to make sure that in a peaceful world people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.

2016-01-14 00:00:00,cavuto," It is 9:00 p.m. here at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in South Carolina. Welcome to the sixth Republican presidential of the 2016 campaign here on the Fox Business Network. I'm Neil Cavuto alongside my friend and co-moderator Maria Bartiromo. Now the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls as well as polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight. And here they are. Businessman Donald Trump. Texas senator Ted Cruz. Florida senator Marco Rubio. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson. New Jersey governor Chris Christie. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush. And Ohio governor John Kasich. Governor Kasich we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year but investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable. Now if this escalates like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as in this example you are taking over the presidency? Governor Bush the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker well it's just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further sir saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say? So I take it from that you do not agree with the president. Senator Rubio the president says that ISIS doesn't threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages. But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now? Thank you Senator. Mr. Trump at the State of the Union the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack. Now he fled that country seeking asylum here ultimately ended up in Detroit where he's now trying to start a new life. The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that? All right. Welcome back to the Republican presidential  right here in North Charleston South Carolina. Let's get right back to the questions. And I'll start with you Senator Cruz. Now you are of course a strict constitutionalist no one would doubt that. And as you know the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if you've heard this before. Now you were born... ... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you Donald Trump and others have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born and that has raised questions about your eligibility.Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight? Mr. Trump... ...that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers. Why are you saying this now right now? Why are you raising this issue now? Senator do you want to respond? Marco Rubio. I'm sorry it's the time constraints. You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late and I will allow the governor to respond as well. The governor went so far to say you won't be able to slime your way to the White House. He's referring to a series of ads done by a PAC speaking on your behalf that say quote""One high tax Common Core liberal energy-loving Obamacare Medicaid-expanding president is enough. You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor? That is not my question. Is he a liberal? Is he a liberal? Governor? You were? Well we are not done. Coming up one of the top things people are talking about on Facebook guns. And you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home. You can go to Facebook.com/ . We will be streaming live and talking about how we think the is going so far. We're back in a moment in Charleston South Carolina. Senator Rubio you said that President Obama wants to take people's guns away. Yet under his presidency gun sales have more than doubled. That doesn't sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners. But what fact can you point to Senator what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone's gun? You don't think that's ? Governor Christie you too have criticized the president's recent executive action on gun control saying it's unconstitutional another step to bypass Congress. But hasn't your own position on guns evolved sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms and that you argued back in August 2013 and I quote ""These common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws."" So isn't that kind of what the president wants to do now? Maria... Governor bush for the third time in as many months the Iranians have provoked us detaining us as we've been discussing with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters. The sailors were released but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles. Now you've claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama. I wonder sir what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush? Thank you Governor. Governor Kasich while everyone has been focusing on Iran's provocations I'm wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region including its execution of a well-known Shi'ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business. Sure enough oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver's seat. U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these who needs enemies? Do you agree? Thank you John. Now the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls as well as polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight.

2016-01-14 00:00:00,kasich," Look it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. It's the same thing that I did in Ohio. It's a simple formula: common sense regulations which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts if you cut taxes for corporations and you cut taxes for individuals you're going to make things move particularly the corporate tax which is the highest of course in the in the world. But in addition to that we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.Right now you don't have the you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations I mean come on they're affecting everybody here particularly our small businesses. They are they're in a position where they're smothering people. And I mean are you kidding me? We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because I've done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee working with Senator Domenici. And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.Our wages are growing faster than the national average. We're running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life. Well if that's the case we're going to win every state if Bernie Sanders is the nominee. That's not even an issue. But look... ...and I know Bernie and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States. So here's this the situation I think Maria. And this is what we have to I I've got to tell you when wages don't rise and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years it's very very difficult for them.Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need. Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.People are upset about it. I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work and you don't know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds because they've got great value.I'll tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college they have high debt and they can't get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high higher education but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist that are good jobs that can pay. Let me tell you that in this country in this country people are concerned about their economic future. They're very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to keeping them from getting it.That's not the America that I've ever known. My father used to say ""Johnny we never we don't hate the rich. We just want to be the rich."" And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools in K-through-12 and in vocational education in higher education.And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists because it does with rising wages with full employment and with everybody in America and I mean everybody in America having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.I'm president look I've done it once. I've done it once in Washington with great jobs and lower taxes. The economy was really booming.And now in Ohio with the same formula wages higher than the than the national average. A growth of 385000 jobs. It's not that hard. Just know where you want to go stick to your guts. Get it done because our our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. And folks we will. You count on it. Well let me let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years and by the way one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you... ...that after the 9/11 attacks Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting I suggested we had a problem with technology and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America and even after 9/11 to be involved. With Saudi Arabia and oil production first of all it's so critical for us to be energy independent and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because see energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility and secondly if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry low prices make the difference.We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country. And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.In terms of Saudi Arabia look my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you whether I'm president or not we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them. So look in foreign policy in foreign policy it's strength but you've got to be cool. You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. And I'm going to tell you that it I'm going to suggest to you here tonight that you can't do on the job training. I've seen so much of it a Soviet Union the coming down of a wall the issues that we saw around the world in Central America the potential spread of communism and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudi's deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.Thank you. Look it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. It's the same thing that I did in Ohio. It's a simple formula: common sense regulations which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year except for health and safety.

Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.People are upset about it. I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work and you don't know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds because they've got great value.I'll tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college they have high debt and they can't get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high higher education but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist that are good jobs that can pay. Let me tell you that in this country in this country people are concerned about their economic future. They're very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to keeping them from getting it.That's not the America that I've ever known. My father used to say ""Johnny we never we don't hate the rich. We just want to be the rich."" And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools in K-through-12 and in vocational education in higher education.And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists because it does with rising wages with full employment and with everybody in America and I mean everybody in America having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.I'm president look I've done it once. I've done it once in Washington with great jobs and lower taxes. The economy was really booming.And now in Ohio with the same formula wages higher than the than the national average. A growth of 385000 jobs. It's not that hard. Just know where you want to go stick to your guts. Get it done because our our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. And folks we will. You count on it. Well let me let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years and by the way one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you... ...that after the 9/11 attacks Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting I suggested we had a problem with technology and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America and even after 9/11 to be involved. With Saudi Arabia and oil production first of all it's so critical for us to be energy independent and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because see energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility and secondly if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry low prices make the difference.We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country. And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.In terms of Saudi Arabia look my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you whether I'm president or not we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them. So look in foreign policy in foreign policy it's strength but you've got to be cool. You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. And I'm going to tell you that it I'm going to suggest to you here tonight that you can't do on the job training. I've seen so much of it a Soviet Union the coming down of a wall the issues that we saw around the world in Central America the potential spread of communism and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudi's deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.Thank you."
2016-01-14 00:00:00,cruz," Well Maria thank you for that question and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us. Let me start I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs but I want to start with something. Today many of us picked up our newspapers and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees with their hands on their heads.In that State of the Union President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I'll tell you it was heartbreaking. But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage. And I give you my word if I am elected president no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America. Now on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know he's right. If you're a Washington lobbyist if you make your money in and around Washington things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country and not Washington D.C. Well Maria thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media they don't hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying ""Anybody But Cruz."" Had that actually that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move ""It Follows"" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people. So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece what they mentioned is when I was running for senate unlike Hillary Clinton I don't have masses of money in the bank hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I we ended up investing everything we owned.We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that's the best the New York Times has got they better go back to the well. Well Neil I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening. You know back in September my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue. Now since September the Constitution hasn't changed. But the poll numbers have. And I recognize I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.If a soldier has a child abroad that child is a natural-born citizen. That's why John McCain even though he was born in Panama was eligible to run for president.If an American missionary has a child abroad that child is a natural-born citizen. That's why George Romney Mitt's dad was eligible to run for president even though he was born in Mexico.At the end of the day the legal issue is quite straightforward but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil but have two parents born on U.S. soil.Under that theory not only would I be disqualified Marco Rubio would be disqualified Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and interestingly enough Donald J. Trump would be disqualified. Because because Donald's mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized. Now Donald... ... on the issue on the issue of citizenship Donald... ... on the issue of citizenship Donald I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you. You're an American as is everybody else on this stage and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief because that's the most important question facing the country. Neil... Well listen I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. And I'll tell you I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump. The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused... ... on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. He's a left-wing judicial activist Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore. He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me because Hillary... ... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election. And I'll tell you what Donald you you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot. I'll tell you what. If this all works out I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right you could get the top job at the end of the day. Actually I'd love to get you to build a wall. The answer is simple. Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know a minute ago Neil asked: What has President Obama do done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns? Well he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.He launched Fast and Furious illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.There were four dissenters and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever which means if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one two three maybe four Supreme Court justices the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.And I'll note that California senator Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America ""give me your guns I'm rounding them up"" she would. And let me make a final point on this. Listen in any Republican primary everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane... ...that's what you say in a primary. But the voters are savvier than that. They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words. I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment. There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award... ...and there's a reason when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms that I led the opposition along with millions of Americans we defeated that gun control legislation.And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight. You know I think most people know exactly what New York values are. What what you're from New York? So you might not. But I promise you in the state of South Carolina they do. And listen there are many many wonderful wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage focus around money and the media.And and I would note indeed the reason I said that is I was asked my friend Donald has taken to it as advance playing Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the USA"" and I was asked what I thought of that.And I said ""well if he wanted to play a song maybe he could play 'New York New York'?"" And and you know the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.Not too many years ago Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. And in that interview he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very very different from the views he's describing now.And his explanation he said ""look I'm from New York that's what we believe in New York. Those aren't Iowa values but this is what we believe in New York."" And so that was his explanation. And and I guess I can can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I'm just saying. Well Maria thank you for that question and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us. Let me start I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs but I want to start with something. Today many of us picked up our newspapers and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees with their hands on their heads.In that State of the Union President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.

2016-01-14 00:00:00,moderators, Maria Bartiromo (Fox Business Network); and Neil Cavuto (Fox Business Network)
2016-03-09 00:00:00,ramos  , Here with us tonight is Karen Tumulty Washington Post correspondent specialized in national policy. But before we continue we want to welcome Sebastian de la Cruz who is going to sing the national anthem. Sebastian welcome. Good evening. We will make our questions in English and they will be translated simultaneously into Spanish for our viewers. And right now each one of them has one minute for your initial words. We begin with Secretary Clinton. So this is the moment of talking about deportations. We're going to immigrants. We're back to the Democratic debate. Secretary Clinton the last time we talked in January in Iowa I asked you if you could be the next deporting chief. And you told me no that you wouldn't be the next deporter in chief. However you refused two times to say you would not deport children. This is what you said. We remind you that you can download and we'll come back with the Democratic presidential debate. which has heads of space and it's the candidates to the presidents that are the . We want to use these last moments it's very important to go out and vote remember next Tuesday March 15th is elections in Florida Illinois Missouri North Carolina Ohio all these states in all these states the Hispanic vote is crucial . Talk about the importance of Hispanic votes how in very close races it is the Hispanic vote that can choose the next president of the United States. This is Hispanic power but the only way that this can happen is if we all go out and vote. So you know it perfectly who does not vote doesn't count.
2016-03-09 00:00:00,clinton," Thank you very much. I've been looking forward to this debate and I want to thank Univision the Washington Post Facebook and Miami-Dade College the largest college in North America for hosting us here this evening. And tonight I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead starting with the economic ones. My focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax making them pay back any tax breaks they've gotten.But we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing. for small businesses and entrepreneurs for more clean energy jobs. And I also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president. And I will also be talking about education every child deserves a good teacher and a good school. And so thank you for having us and I look forward to the debate. Well look I won one of the contests and lost another close one. I am continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country. I was pleased that I got 100000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates. So this is a marathon and it's a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that I'm running a campaign that reaches out to everybody a campaign that offers real positive solutions to the problems that we face a campaign that is based on how together we can make progress because I am a progressive who likes to get things done.So I'm excited about the upcoming contests including right here in Florida. And we'll continue to work as hard as I can to earn the vote of every single voter. It was a very close race. We've had some of those. I've won some. I've lost some. But you know I was very pleased by the overall outcome last night. And now we're on to the states for next Tuesday and I'm looking forward to campaigning hard in all of them. Well Jorge there's a lot of questions in there. And I'm going to give the same answer I've been giving for many months. It wasn't the best choice. I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed. And as I have said and as now has come out my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government. But here's the cut to the chase facts. I did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time. What you are talking about is retroactive classification. And the reason that happens is when somebody asks or when you are asked to make information public I asked all my emails to be made public. Then all the rest of the government gets to weigh in. And some other parts of the government we're not exactly sure who has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified. They've just said the same thing to former Secretary Colin Powell. They have said we're going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally. Now I think he was right when he said this is an absurdity. And I think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification. I am not concerned about it. I am not worried about it and no Democrat or American should be either. There was no permission to be asked. It had been done by my predecessors. It was permitted. Oh for goodness that's not going to happen. I'm not even answering that question. Karen I'm going to follow my friend Senator Sanders model here. If I'm so fortunate enough to be the Democratic nominee there will be a lot of time to talk about him. I was the first one to call him out. I called him out when he was calling Mexicans rapists. When he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive. I said basta and I am pleased that others... ...others are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric his demagoguery his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system. Especially from somebody running for president who couldn't decide whether or not to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke. So people can draw their own conclusions about him. I will just end by saying this. You don't make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great. I think it's un-American. I think what he has promoted is not at all in keeping with American values Karen. And I am going to take every opportunity to criticize him to raise those issues. I'm not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses. I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee by pointing out what he has said. What he claims to believe in The values he's promoting and I think that's a better way for the American people to draw their conclusions. In 2003 I sponsored the DREAMER Act. I sponsored I think in every Congress after that. I have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. I think our best chance was in 2007 when Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform. We have Republican support. We had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Senator Sanders voted against it.Just think imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago. Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one; no longer fearing that they would be found out.So I am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career. If I could... You know I think it's very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy Barack Obama me La Raza United Farmworkers Dolores Huerta leaders of the Latino community would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery. That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill. And I will go back to what I said. If we had been able to get that passed we would be so much further along now. I'm committed to defending DAPA and DACA. I'm committed to going even further to get more people deferred action to go as far as I can under the law. And I am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship in the first 100 days of my presidency. Let me let me respond again because the misrepresentation can't go unanswered here. First of all that is something that is not fair about what I said. I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country on their own very often many of them not making it. And when they got here they needed as I have argued for legal counsel due process to make a decision. We need to end private detention we need to end family detention.And in 2006 when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.So I think when you were running for the Senate you made it clear by your vote Senator that you were going to stand with the Republicans. When you got to the Senate in 2007 one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform which he'd been working on for years before you ever arrived. Great. Thank you. Here's what I can promise Jorge I can promise that I will do everything possible to provide due process. Let me say this. I would give every person but particularly children due process to have their story told. And a lot of children will of course have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay. Yes you can because the question you were asking me were about children seeking asylum. And we have laws. That was the most critical thing I said. Under our laws. I would like to see those laws changed. I would like see added to them a guaranteed counsel and other support for children. But if you are asking about everyone who is already here undocumented immigrants the 11-12 million who are living here my priorities are to deport violent criminals terrorists and anyone who threatens our safety. So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does. I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform but at the same time stop the raids stop the round-ups stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives doing their jobs and that's my priority. I will not deport children. I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either Jorge. I want to as I said prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals people planning terrorist attacks anybody who threatens us. That's a relatively small universe. I will not. That's what I'm telling you. Now I don't want because I'm not contradicting what I told you in the interview. Asylum is a particular legal process. I'd like to see it changed. I'd like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence that they do. But under our law we have a process we have to go through which is different. I would stop... Yes. Of the people the undocumented people living in our country I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That is exactly what I will do. This is why I go back to that 2007 vote because if we had been successful then a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in the rear-view mirror. I want us to be able to achieve comprehensive immigration reform if I'm so fortunate enough to be president. And we do have to take a look at asylum laws. When I was secretary of state I worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in Central America. I was there meeting with leaders security leaders and others. And I think the Congress should support the president's request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in Central America helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries. Let me just conclude by saying that United Farm Workers considered that bill in their words the last best hope for farm workers and immigrants. They have proven to be right in the succeeding years. I only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next Congress. And as I said earlier in 2006 Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation... ...and stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous absurd efforts to quote ""hunt down immigrants. So look I think the goal here is to elect a Democratic Senate elect a Democratic president and get to work immediately to get comprehensive immigration reform. Well let's do that. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about the auto bailout because I think it's important for people to understand what happened. In December of 2008 we were both in the Senate there was a vote on a free-standing bill to rescue the auto industry. We both voted for it. was the right vote. Unfortunately it did not succeed. The Republicans marshalled the votes against it. A month later in January a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue. Then President-elect Obama before he'd even been sworn in sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it. He was still in the Senate I was still in the Senate.And I voted for it. It was a hard vote. I'll tell you it was a hard vote. A lot of the votes you make are hard votes. But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill. Now Senator Sanders voted against it. That's his perfect right to vote against it. But if everyone had voted as he voted... ... we would not have rescued the auto industry. Well I think both of us both Senator Sanders and I voted numerous times to enhance border security along our border. We increased the number of border security agents. We did vote for money to build a fence a pedestrian fence in some place a vehicle fence in other places. And the result is that we have the most secure border we've ever had. Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest they've been in 40 years which just strengthens my argument that now it's time to do comprehensive immigration reform. The Republicans the opponents no longer have an argument. And certainly we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality. We raised money through the congressional appropriations process. We enhanced the border security. That part of the work is done.Everybody that I know has looked at it said okay we have a secure border. There's no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery that's still is carried out on the Republican side. You've run out of excuses. Let's move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it. It's a big difference. First of all as I understand him he's talking about a very tall wall. Right? A beautiful tall wall. The most beautiful tall wall better than the Great Wall of China that would run the entire border. That he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for. And you know it's just fantasy. And in fact if he cared to know anything about what members of Congress like the senator and I have done where it was necessary we did support some fencing.Where it was necessary we did add border patrol agents. We have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job quote ""securing the border"". So let's get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform. First of all please know how brave I think you are coming here with your children to tell your story. This is an incredible act of courage that I'm not sure many people really understand. And I want you to know that in the work that I've done and the many families that I've met I have heard similar stories like yours where your husband is deported. Your children's father is gone. You are doing your very best to support your children. But it is time to bring families together. And I don't think there's any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human cost of these policies are.And I will do everything I can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing. And I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together. And I hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has put into place DACA and DAPA because I will defend those and I will absolutely protect your children yourself and try to bring your family back together. Well first Karen obviously it's painful for me to hear that. And I do take responsibility. When you're in public life even if you believe that it's not an opinion that you think is fair or founded you do have to take responsibility. And I do. And I also have you know very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people. That's something that I care deeply about. And I will continue to do that to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me.That is certainly what happened to me in New York where people got to know me. They saw me in action. And they did.Look I have said before and it won't surprise anybody to hear me say it this is not easy for me. It's not easy to do what I think is right to help people to even the odds to hear a story like the woman's story we just heard. And to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.I am not a natural politician in case you haven't noticed like my husband or President Obama. So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can get the results I can make a difference in people's lives and hope that people see that I'm fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families. Well let me respond as I have numerous times during this campaign. You know I have a public record and you can go look it up. I went to Wall Street before the Great Recession and basically called them out said that their behavior was putting our economy at risk called for a moratorium on foreclosures. I went to the Orlando area during the '08 campaign to make the same case visiting with families who had been defrauded by mortgages these subprime mortgages that put them and their homes at risk. I called for those changes. I have been on the record and now I do have the toughest most comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street. And not just the big banks all the other financial interests that pose a threat to our economy. And I have said no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail and I will use the powers that have now been passed by the Congress by President Obama who incidentally took a lot of money from Wall Street which didn't stop him from signing into law the toughest regulations on the financial industry since the Great Depression. Wait a minute. I just think it's worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry the Koch brothers have just paid to put up an ad praising Senator Sanders. There are a lot of different powerful interests in Washington. I've taken them on. I took on the drug companies. I took on the insurance companies. Before there was something called Obamacare there was something called Hillarycare and I worked really hard... ...to get comprehensive health care reform and they beat me. So I have a long record of standing up to special interests. And I will continue to do so. Well if I can say... ... you know though I guess Senator Sanders that the Koch brothers as you said are sensible with how they use their money. And I agree with you. They stand for things that I find abhorrent that would be bad for our country bad for our future. But they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only Democrat who stood with the Republicans to try to eliminate the Export/Import Bank which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in Florida be able to export their goods and employ more Floridians. So from my perspective you sided with the Koch brothers. You know look. I feel a great deal of sympathy for the families of the four brave Americans that we lost at Benghazi. And I certainly can't even imagine the grief that she has for losing her son but she's wrong. She's absolutely wrong. I and everybody in the administration all the people she named the president the vice president Susan Rice we were scrambling to get information that was changing literally by the hour. And when we had information we made it public. But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it.So I testified for 11 hours. Anybody who watched that and listened to it knows that I answered every question that I was asked and when it was over the Republicans had to admit they didn't learn anything. Why? Because there had already been one independent investigation. There had been seven or eight congressional investigations mostly led by Republicans who all reached the same conclusions that there were lessons to be learned.And this is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack. We lost 3000 people on 9/11. We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president. We lost 250 Americans both military and civilian when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut.And at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized .Instead people said let's learn the lessons and save lives. And that's when I did. Jorge that makes my point. At the time I e-mailed with my daughter a terrorist group had taken credit for the attacks on our facility in Benghazi. Within 16 18 hours they rescinded taking credit. They did it all on social media. And the video did play a role. We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video. This was fog of war. This was complicated. The most effective comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that.Look as I said in the beginning I deeply regret that we lost four Americans. And I of course sympathize with members of the families who are still you know very much grieving. And I wish that there could be an easy answer at the time but we learned a lot and the intelligence kept... ... improving and we learned enough to say what we think happened at Benghazi. Well I certainly know what all Americans need and that is more jobs with rising incomes. It's something that I have worked on for many years. It's why I've laid down the only really comprehensive plan about how to create more good jobs. And there are several things that need to be addressed. We do have to do more infrastructure spending. That will put many Americans to work. It's a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class. We need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs. We need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in America.We also do have to combat climate change and no state has more at stake in that than Florida. And the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have but also the clean power plan that President Obama has put forth that I support and the Paris agreement that I think was a huge step forward in the world that Senator Sanders said was too weak but I helped to lay the groundwork for that.But we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses. You know the fastest-growing segment of small businesses are minority and women-owned small business and we need to help businesses get started.The very distinguished congresswoman from New York who's been on the Small Business Committee Congresswoman Velasquez knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses. We do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women. That will help Latinos as well as every other working person in our country. Everything I just said will improve the living conditions and I've spent a lot of time and effort talking to and mostly listening to Latinos. Jobs are the number one issue with rising incomes. Close behind is education. Every child deserves a good teacher in a good school regardless of the zip code that they live in. Following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to build on the Affordable Care Act and provide access to health care. And then there are a number of other issues comprehensive immigration reform certainly at the top. Well congratulations on your education. And also on your plans for the future. And here's what I will do. We're going to refinance everyone's existing student debt 40 million Americans have student debt. And right now I go around asking people at my events if they know what their interest rate is and the interest rates literally go from like 8 percent to 14 percent. It's outrageous that at a time when interest rates have been historically low people borrowing money to invest in their education are paying some of the highest interest rates around.And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate. You can refinance your car. Corporations can refinance their debt. Under my plan you will be able to also lower your debt move into a program to pay it back as a percentage of your income and more than that my plan for debt-free tuition at public colleges and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt.But for people who have it I'm going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years you no longer have to pay anything. The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education. Well I'm going to respond to that because I think it's a very important issue. And by the way everybody who quote ""got money"" in the quote ""bailout"" that also included money for the auto rescue has paid it back. So the Treasury was out nothing. Now that will no longer happen because we have Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy. But let me say this. Senator Sanders has talked about free college for everybody. He's talked about universal single payer health care for everybody. And yet when you ask questions as many of us have and more importantly independent experts it's very hard to get answers.And a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to. This is going to increase the federal government dramatically. And you know my dad used to say if it sounds too good to be true it probably is. And we deserve answers about how these programs will actually work and how they would be paid for. This is a very important point in this debate because I do believe in universal coverage. Remember I fought for it 25 years ago. I believe in it. And I know that thanks the Affordable Care Act we are now 90 percent of universal coverage. I will build on the Affordable Care Act. I will take it further. I will reduce the cost. But I just respectfully disagree. Between the Republicans trying to repeal the first chance we've ever had to get to universal health care and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act. Make it work. Reduce the cost. Well Karen first of all I was proud a number of mayors from Florida campaign for me in South Carolina. I had a chance to talk to some of them about this issue. It is a really serious one. And there isn't much time left to do several things that I will move quickly to do. You can see already what's happening in Miami particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising. So we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly man-made and man-aggravated. And there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that I will absolutely support. All the Republican say they will if they're elected heaven forbid repeal all of those executive actions. I will maintain them and act on them.The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing which makes absolutely no sense. We need to implement all of the president's executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future. And when I talk about resilience I think that is an area we can get Republican support on. Because because after all excuse me. Excuse me excuse me. After all there are... You know you don't you know you don't have to do much more than look at rising insurance rates. You know most of the property in Florida will be at risk in the next 50 years. I think I can get a bipartisan consensus on resilience and then implementing the president's orders until we frankly win back enough seats take back the Senate and get back to bipartisan... Well Karen I do agree that we have to end the revolving door. I strongly support a piece of legislation from Senator Tammy Baldwin that would do just that. And I will be looking for people who will put the interests of consumers first who will do more to try to make sure Main Street flourishes. And I will very much reach out and ask for advice as to who should be appointed including to Senator Warren and many of my other former colleagues in the Senate. But I think it's important also to look at what we want to accomplish. You know in the debates we've had maybe this is the seventh or so Senator Sanders is always criticizing the two recent Democratic presidents President Clinton and President Obama. And that's fine but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession. You know at the end of the '90s we had 23 million new jobs. Incomes went up for everybody. We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for Latinos and African Americans. Well we were doing it by the end of the '90s. Median family income went up 17 percent. For minorities it went up even more.Along came the Republicans trickle-down economics one of the worst ideas since snake oil was put back into place. And we ended up with the great recession. President Obama had to rescue the economy. And I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that. Well first of all I supported the president's moves. I helped to implement some of them leading up to the announcements when I was secretary of state expanding travel opportunities remittances. And I certainly told the president toward the end of my time that I hoped he would be able to move toward diplomatic relations and to make more of an impact by building up the relationship. And there are no better ambassadors for freedom democracy and economic opportunity than Cuban Americans.So the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward greater freedom greater respect for rights.You know I'm looking forward to following the president's trip. I do think meeting with dissidents meeting with people who have been voices tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important.The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads. And I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba. I hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people and I hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country. That is my hope. Absolutely although it happens before I am president if I am so fortunate to be. I have been calling for months that the Congress must give authority to Puerto Rico to restructure its debts. Just like it has enabled states and cities to restructure their debt. And it's a grave injustice for the Congress led by the Republicans to be refusing to enact that opportunity within the bankruptcy law.And what we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering. We see schools being closed we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto Rican families a month moving to the United States mostly to Florida.Puerto Ricans are citizen of America. They deserve to be treated as citizens and to be given the opportunity to get back on their feet economically. And I just want to add one thing to the question you were asking Senator Sanders. I think in that same interview he praised what he called the revolution of values in Cuba and talked about how people were working for the common good not for themselves.I just couldn't disagree more. You know if the values are that you oppress people you disappear people you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions for expressing freedom of speech that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere. Well I think this is one of the most important issues facing our country right now. And I fully support President Obama's intention under the constitution to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia. And I believe... ...I believe no state probably understands this better than Florida. Because let's remember three words: Bush versus Gore. A court took away a presidency. Now we've got the Republican Congress trying to take away the constitution. And we should not tolerate that. And so from my perspective it is imperative that we put enormous pressure on the Republicans in the Senate to do their constitutional duty. Now obviously you look for people who are not only qualified on paper but have a heart have life experience understand what these decisions mean in the lives of Americans.And understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other. So clearly I would look for people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law and that Citizens United needs to be overturned as quickly as possible. Well thank you very much for a lively debate. And I appreciate greatly all the questions especially the questions in person from the people here and those coming at us from Facebook. It just reinforces my strong commitment to do everything I can to break down all the barriers that stand in the way of people living up to their own potential and of our country doing the same. So I am going to take on those economic barriers. I have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes. I'm going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling. I'm going to take on the healthcare barriers.I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we unite our country. I will find common ground just as I have as first lady as senator and secretary of state. I will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake. I would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on Tuesday and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president."
2016-03-09 00:00:00,sanders, Thank you thank you all very much. I'm running for president of the United States because given the crises facing our country it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. Together we're going to have to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision. Billionaires and Wall Street should not be buying elections. We've got to end this rigged economy where people are working longer hours for low wages almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent and of course we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.And here in Miami... ...here in Miami as much as any city in America we know that we have got to combat climate change transform our energy system and leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and our grandchildren. Well you know when we began this campaign I was 3% in the polls. I was probably 60 or 70 points behind the Secretary. We have come a long way in 10 months. We have won... ...including Michigan last night which some peopleconsidered one of the major political upsets in modern American history. We have won nine state primaries and caucuses. And I believe that our message of the need for people to stand up and tell corporate America and Wall Street that they cannot have it all is resonating across this country. And I think in the coming weeks and months we are going to continue to do extremely well win a number of these primaries and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump. There is a process under way and that process will take its course. Today in America the middle class is disappearing. We have massive levels of income and wealth inequality climate change threatens the whole planet 47 million people live in poverty. I'm going to focus on the issues facing the working families of this country. That process specifically. This is what I think. I think that the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans who insults Muslims who insults women who insults African-Americans. And let us not forget that several years ago Trump was in the middle of the so- called birther movement trying to delegitimize the president of the United States of America. You know I find it very interesting Karen my dad was born in Poland. I know a little bit about the immigrant experience. Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate. Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin. And I am very pleased I am very pleased that I think in the last national poll that I saw we were running 18 points ahead of Donald Trump. Poverty is increasing. And if wages are going down I don't know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guestworkers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now. Well you have guestworker programs that have been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center one of the important institutions in this country who studies these issues as guestworkers programs akin to slavery where people came in. They were cheated. They were abused. They were humiliated. And if they stood up for their rights they would be thrown out of the country. Of course that type of leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people. And I worked very hard on that issue. And of course I supported the 2013 immigration reform bill. And what I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform if the Congress does not do its job as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done to do what President Obama did and expand on that. Well we do the best we don't know. And I should also say with regard to that 2007 immigration bill as you may know LULAC the major Hispanic organization in his country also opposed that bill as did many other Latino organizations. But to your point we have to do the best we can. I applaud President Obama for his efforts on DAPA and DACA. And I think we have got to expand those efforts. Well when we talk about efforts to assist immigrants Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York Elliot Spitzer who wanted to do the right thing and provide driver's license to these who were undocumented she said don't do it and New York State still does not do it. In Vermont by the way I worked with officials and undocumented people in Vermont do have the ability to get driver's license. When we talk about immigration the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where there's probably more violence than almost any place in this country and they came into this country. And I said welcome those children into this country Secretary Clinton said send them back. That's a difference. Let me respond let me respond to that. You know Ted Kennedy was a very close friend of mine and I served on the committee he chaired the Health Education Labor Committee. And Ted Kennedy was kind enough to allow me to hold a hearing in 2008 I believe in Congress dealing with the plight of undocumented tomato pickers in Immokalee Florida. And I went there on my own. Wasn't an issue really for the state of Vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi slavery if you like that those workers lived under. And the result of that hearing and the work that many many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers. Let me just say this. I don't think that the secretary fully answered your question and I think the proof may be in the pudding. Honduras and that region of the world may be the most violent region in our hemisphere. Gang lords vicious people torturing people doing horrible things to families. Children fled that part of the world to try try try try maybe to meet up with their family members in this country taking a route that was horrific trying to start a new life. Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country. I did.Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many many issues. I think he has done a great job as president of the United States. He is wrong on this issue of deportation. I disagree with him on that. So to answer your question no I will not deport children from the United States of America. I can make that promise. Let me just answer I want to get back to this 2007 immigration bill. It's true Ted Kennedy a good friend of mine and I think of the secretary's did work very hard on that bill. But does anyone really believe that if that bill was all so good as the secretary is touting that LULAC and other major Latino organizations the largest Latino organizations in this country said no to that bill. And I worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like slaves. It's... I'm sorry? Of course not. There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation. What the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it. No I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry. No I do not support vigilantes and that is a horrific statement an unfair statement to make. I will stand of my career political career fighting for workers fighting for the poorest people in this country. Madame Secretary I will match my record against yours any day of the week. Yeah let me... Let me let's so that everybody knows the bill that Secretary Clinton is talking about that is that was the bailout of the recklessness irresponsibility and illegal behavior of Wall Street. It was the Wall Street bailout. And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton who was the former senator of New York of course when she defended her vote she said well it's going to help the big banks in New York. Those are my constituents. And then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile workers. There was an article just yesterday... ... where people like Senator Bayh and Ron Wyden Byron Dorgan... ...former senators said no this wasn't the automobile bailout. It was the bailout of Wall Street. Let me just say... I think the secretary and I mostly I think agree on this issue. Look in this country immigration reform is a very hot debate. It's divided the country. But I would hope very much that as we have that debate we do not as Donald Trump and others have done resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry. This idea of suddenly one day or maybe a night rounding up 11 million people and taking them outside of this country is a vulgar absurd idea that I would hope very few people in America support. Well I absolutely support that. At the heart of my immigration policy and I should say that the New York times editorial board called my immigration policy the most progressive and the strongest of any candidate running. But to answer your question the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families not to divide families. The idea that a mother is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is wrong and immoral. A number of months ago I talked to a young man who was serving in the United States military and while he was serving in the military his wife was deported.That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist. So ma'am I will do everything that I can to unite your family. Your children deserve to be with their mother. Well what I have said is that when you get I believe it is $225000 for giving a speech and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs one of the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago when you get paid $225000 that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech. I would think that a speech so great that you got paid so much money for you would like to share it with the American people. So I think she should release the transcript. As the secretary said well she will do it if other people do it. I will do it. I didn't give any speeches there is no transcript. That is exactly what releasing the transcripts will tell us. This I do know. This I do know. There is a reason why Wall Street has provided $15 million just in the last reporting period to the secretary's super PAC. Now the secretary says it doesn't influence her. Well that's what every politician says who gets money from special interests. The question that the American people have to determine - you know can you say that Wall Street is greedy they're fraudulent but they're not dumb. Why are they making those kind of large contributions? Look clearly clearly the secretary's words to Wall Street has really intimidated them and that is why they have given her $15 million in campaign contributions. Now what I believe is in fact that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. And it's not just Wall Street it's the drug companies received millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry. We've got to overturn Citizens United and end that. There is nobody in the United States Congress who has taken on the Koch brothers who want to destroy Social Security Medicare Medicaid and virtually every federal program passed since the 1930s more that Bernie Sanders. And I am proud that the gentleman who is head of Goldman Sachs now he didn't give me $225000 for speaking fees he said I was dangerous and he's right. I am dangerous for Wall Street. Let me respond. The Export/Import Bank is often called the bank of Boeing because Boeing corporation gets 40 percent of the revenue. It is corporate welfare and yes I oppose corporate welfare. Well I'm not going to comment on the Benghazi tragedy but I will say this. A series of articles in the New York Times talked about Secretary Clinton's role in urging the administration to go forward with regime change getting rid of Gadhafi in Libya. Gadhafi was a brutal dictator there's no question. But one of the differences between the secretary and I is I'm not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change. I voted against the war in Iraq because I had a fear of what would happen the day after. And Secretary Clinton talks about Henry Kissinger... ... winning the praise of Henry Kissinger I don't want Henry Kissinger's praise at all. Well you've got to look at what the career is about. And this is a career that has stood up to every special interest in this country. I don't take money from Wall Street. I demand that we break up the large financial institutions. I don't take money from the pharmaceutical industry because I believe they are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. I don't take money from the fossil fuel industry because they are destroying they are destroying this planet through their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are seeing.So I think it is true that I have served in Congress for many years. But if you check my record it is a record of strength for the environment for workers for seniors. Unlike the secretary I believe we should expand Social Security benefits. It is a record of achievement for veterans working with Republicans helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades.So I think the point is look at the record and it's a record that I am proud of. OK let me answer that question because it's a huge question. And one of the huge I know. One of the points that I've been making and media does not seem to pick up on it is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent but youth unemployment in this country.If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed... Oh wait a minute. Can I have... ... a little bit of time here please? African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent. That's why I co-sponsored legislation to put $5 billion into a jobs program to put our kids to work because I would rather invest in education and jobs than jails and incarceration. We have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right. We need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. And when we do that under my plan we create 13 million decent-paying jobs. No I do not propose free college tuition I proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities. Yes I did. No. What they would look this is what I believe Jorge. This is the year 2016. Fifty years ago a high school degree got you a good job in the economy. Today in many respects a college degree is the equivalent of a high school degree. We have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education. So I do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free and I don't believe we should punish millions of young and not-so-young people with outrageous levels of student debt. Absolutely. Absolutely. They can go I don't think they will but Donald Trump's kids Donald Trump's kids can go to public school right now I think Secretary Clinton is talking about making community colleges free they can go to those things. The point is we are going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires. But all of our people in my view regardless of income should have a right to get a higher education. I want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard no matter what the income of their families my family didn't have any income my parents didn't go to college they didn't have good income. I want every kid to know if you do your school work study hard yes you will be able to get a college education. I think what Secretary Clinton just said is absolutely right. I think I said it many months before she said it but thanks for copying a very good idea. Now the question though you know I have been criticized a lot for thinking big. You know that's for believing that we can do great things as a nation. One of the things we should not be doing obviously is punishing people for doing what we want them to do and that is to get an education. But here is the point. My program making public colleges and universities tuition free allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a fairly expensive proposal about $70 billion a year.You know how I'm going to pay for it? I'm going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation. We bailed out Secretary Clinton was one of those who voted to bail out Wall Street. Now I think it's time for Wall Street to help the working families of this country. All right. Let me respond to this. I want you all to think. What Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all of our people. I think if the rest of the world can do it we can. And by the way not only are we being ripped off by the drug companies we are spending far far more per capita on health care than any other major country on earth.You may not think the American people are prepared to stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies. I think they are. And I think we can pass... I'm on the committee I know a little bit about this I'm on the committee Health Education Labor Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act. And it has done a number of good things. But when Secretary Clinton says well 90 percent of the people have insurance yes not really. Many of you may have insurance but you have outrageously high deductibles and co-payments. One out of five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. Elderly people are cutting their pills in half.I do believe that we should do what every other major country on earth does and I think when the American people stand up and fight back yes we can have it a Medicare for all health care system. Well first of all Karen when you have Republican candidates for president and in Congress telling you that climate change is a hoax which is Donald Trump and other candidates' position what they are really saying is we don't have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry. What candidates are saying is if we stand up to the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from coal and oil and gas to energy efficiency and wind and solar and geothermal and other sustainable technologies you know what happens to that Republican who listens to the scientists? On that day that Republican loses his campaign funding from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry. The way I would move forward in every other area. And what we are doing in this campaign is fighting not only to become president but I'm the only candidate who says no president not Bernie Sanders can do it all. You know what we need Karen? We need a political revolution in this country. And when millions of people stand up and tell the fossil fuel industry that their profits their short-term profits are less significant than the long-term health of this planet we will win. That is the way change always takes place. Let me be very clear... I have introduced... Did you ask me to speak? Madam Secretary when he asked me to speak... have as much time as she just had. Thank you. Let's be clear. You're looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States Senate. Now I hope that Secretary Clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And by the way while we are on the subject of energy I hope you'll join me in ending fracking in the United States of America. Now let me say this. I gather Secretary Clinton hasn't listened to too many of my speeches. Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies. Now when we talk about the policies of the 1990s I worked closely and supported President Clinton. And obviously I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us. But when you go back to the 1990s let's remember that's when Wall Street deregulation took place. That's when disastrous trade policies took place. Yes good things happened but some dangerous mistakes were made that laid the groundwork for some of the problems we're having with a disappearing middle class today. Look I understand that not everybody in Florida or in the United States will agree with me but I think we have got to end the embargo. I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with Cuba. I think at the end of the day it will be a good thing for the Cuban people. It will enable them I think when they see people coming into their country from the United States move in a more democratic direction which is what I want to see. So right I'm sorry. Sure. You may recall way back in when was it 1961 they invaded Cuba and everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world. All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro. They forgot that he educated their kids gave them health care totally transformed their society. Well let me just answer that. What that was about was saying that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba that the United States was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government that the United States was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954 the government democratically elected government of Guatemala. Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we've operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America. So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administration's efforts to overthrow that government. And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende in Chile.I think the United States should be working with governments around the world not get involved in regime change. And all of these actions by the way in Latin America brought forth a lot of very strong anti-American sentiments. That's what that was about. I'm sorry. Please say that... The key issue here was whether the United States should go around overthrowing small Latin American countries. I think that that was a mistake... ...both in Nicaragua and Cuba. Look let's look at the facts here. Cuba is of course an authoritarian undemocratic country and I hope very much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country. But on the other hand... ...on the other hands it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care. They are sending doctors all over the world. They have made some progress in education. I think by restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba it will result in significant improvements to the lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community invest. Well as I said earlier I don't believe it is the business of the United States government to be overthrowing small countries around the world. And number two when you get to Puerto Rico there's an issue that we have not talked about. That little island is $73 billion in debt and the government now is paying interest rates of up to 11 percent. And many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar. And what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico we've got to bring people together. And it's not the people of Puerto Rico or the children or the schools. But maybe some of these vulture capitalists who are going to have to lose a little bit of money in this process. This has been a wonderful debate but time being limited some of the most important issues facing our country have not been asked. And that is is it acceptable that in America the top 0.1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Is it acceptable that while the average American works longer hours for lower wages 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections? Is that democracy or this that oligarchy? Which is why I believe we've got to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.Is it right that in the greatest wealthiest country in the history of the world so many of our young people can't even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt in the wealthiest country in the history of the world? If we stand up fight back we can do a lot better. That's why I'm running for president.
2016-03-09 00:00:00,smith, Hillary and Obama and Panetta and Biden and all of and Susan Rice all told me it was a video when they knew it was not the video. And they said that they would call me and let me know what the outcome was.
2016-03-09 00:00:00,unknown  , I believe that this was the saddest moment that we had here at the debate a mother with her children separated from her husband. And those children suffering because they do not have their father. And this is what we see that is happening that Republicans are doing not by not approving a migratory reform but also President Obama. So we need we need not only words but plans as well. And we need as a community to both stand up and support women as her. We continue with the Democratic debate.
2016-03-09 00:00:00,question, Senator Sanders as you can see these are a very painful and personal issue for Lucia and her family. She wants to know what you would do to stop deportations but most importantly to reunite families like hers. Secretary Clinton thank you. Secretary Clinton they are U.S. citizens . Thank you.Now let's go back to Karen.
2016-03-09 00:00:00,moderators, Jorge Ramos (Univision); Mara Elena Salinas (Univision); Karen Tumulty (The Washington Post)
2016-03-09 00:00:00,question  , We have a question from the public. I want to go to Lucia Aquiette. She's an immigrant from Guatemala she's here with her five children who have not seen their father since he was deported three years ago. She has a question for both of you. I would like to ask me and my children hardworking men in the field . Secretary Clinton you've also said you want to stop deportations. But what's your plan to reunite families and thousands of children U.S. citizens with their parents? The two candidates did a good action of talking explaining but what concerned me a bit is that we we haven't seen the plan of Senator Bernie Sanders and we have not seen a plan in writing from Secretary Hillary Clinton. So we want to see what she says. That is important The six months that we have seen as immigration is concerned and we see that they're moving towards. The community needs to not only immigration reform but the raids have to stop. Families that we have seen that are suffering they have to be reunited. We just heard about free tuition from Senator Sanders but right now there are millions of students who can't afford to pay their loans. Maria Martinez is 20 years old and she's a major of political science at Miami-Dade College.
2016-03-09 00:00:00,salinas, Welcome Karen. Thank you Secretary. Thank you. Senator Sanders your opening remarks. Thank you Senator. First question Secretary you have been starting to sound like the nominee lately but many voters are saying not so fast. Where did you fail last night in Michigan? What went wrong in Michigan? What went wrong in Michigan? What went wrong in Michigan? What failed in Michigan specifically? Senator aside from your astounding upset last night in Michigan you are still far behind Secretary Clinton in delegate count. She has 1221 delegates including superdelegates and you have 571. What is your pathway to make up the deficit and can you realistically catch up? So Secretary I have a question for you. In 2003 you said on a radio show specifically it was John Gambling's radio show in New York that you were adamantly against illegal immigrants and that people have to stop employing illegal immigrants. Your new immigration plan is that you would expand President Obama's executive actions and that you would push for legislation that would include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. So are you flip-flopping on this issue? Or are you pandering to Latinos what some would call Hispandering? Now Senator Sanders in 2007 you voted against immigration reform. You now say that it was because the bill had guestworker provisions which seemed semi-slavery. But back then this is what you said to CNN's Lou Dobbs. Let's listen. So Senator were you concerned with working conditions for guestworkers or really because you think immigrants drive down wages and take jobs from Americans? But if you're saying that you would... ...if you're saying that you would expand on the executive actions how do you that they're not going to end up in a legal battle just like Obama's executive actions? Secretary Sanders (sic). Senator would you like to respond? One last response. Go ahead. Secretary... Your time is up Senator. Senator your time is up Senator. We have to move on. Senator the time is up. We have to move on. Next question. Secretary Clinton you recently said instead of building walls we need to tear down barriers. However last November in New Hampshire you openly said that as senator you voted numerous times to build the wall with Mexico. What's the difference between what you did voting to build the wall and what Donald Trump wants to do now? But the question is what is the difference between the wall that you voted for and Donald Trump's wall? Senator... Now we have a question from the audience for both of you. We're taking a break. We're taking a break. We'll continue with topics that are of interest to Spanish education what to do with student debt. Two topics that we will deal in a moment in the Democratic debate. Secretary Latinos according to the Univision-Washington Post poll the number one issue is jobs and the economy. Latino unemployment rate is higher than the national average. Their net worth has gone down 42 percent during the Obama years and 60 percent of Latinos make less than $15 an hour. So last week you tweeted that for the GOP the economy is an after thought. Well many Latinos feel that they are an after thought. Do you understand what the specific needs of Latinos are to improve their living conditions? Secretary what would you do... Secretary you talked in general terms but you haven't really said what you would specifically do to improve the living conditions of Latinos. Your time is up Secretary sorry your time is up. Your time is up. Thank you Senator. Thank you senator. We're going to break now. Thank you senator. Senator Sanders... Let's continue with another question Senator if you don't mind. In 1985 you praised the Sandinista government and you said that Daniel Ortega was an impressive guy. This is what you said about Fidel Castro. Let's listen. In South Florida there are still open wounds among some exiles regarding socialism and communism. So please explain what is the difference between the socialism that you profess and the socialism in Nicaragua Cuba and Venezuela. Senator in retrospect have you ever regretted the characterizations that you made of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that way? In retrospect have you ever regretted the characterizations of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that you made in 1985? You didn't answer the question. Thank you Senator. Your time is up on that. Secretary and Senator we want to thank both of you for being here for joining us tonight. And of course we also want to thank also the wonderful crowd that was here today. Our audience has been wonderful and thank you for being here.
2016-03-09 00:00:00,ramos,  Secretary Clinton I want to disclose once again that my daughter Paula works for your campaign. And now I have a question about your emails. Your Republican opponents say that those emails have endangered our national security. When you were secretary of state you wrote 104 emails in your private server that the government now says contain classified information according to The Washington Post analysis. That goes against a memo that you personally sent to your employees in 2011 directing all of them to use official email precisely because of security concerns. So it seems that you issued one set of rules for yourself and a different set of rules for the rest of the State Department.So who specifically gave you permission to operate your email system as you did? Was it President Barack Obama? And would you drop out of the race if you get indicted? If we get your permission... Secretary Clinton the questions were who gave you permission to cooperate? Was it President Obama? If you get indicted would you going to drop out? Senator Sanders you have gone from saying the following the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e- mails to claiming that it is a very serious issue. Which is it? On  people are talking about immigration and this map shows where in the country they are talking about it the most. Maria Elena? Senator Secretary we're going to take a break and we'll continue talking about immigration when we come back. And can you promise that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record? But will you deport children? So secretary you seem to be defending President Obama's deportation policy. And as you know so far he has deported more than 2.5 million immigrants. So if you really don't want to be the next deporter in chief can you promise tonight that you won't deport children and that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record and this time could I get a yes or no answer? But again yes or no can you promise tonight that you won't deport children children who are already here? OK. So I want to be very specific. So you are telling us tonight that if you become president you won't deport children who are already here? And that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record? So you will stop those deportations. The deportations for children... ... and those who don't have a criminal record. Senator Sanders would you can you promise us tonight that you won't deport children? And can you promise not to deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record? Did you support the Minutemen Senator? Did you support the Minutemen? Did you support the Minutemen as Secretary Clinton has said? Secretary you said this morning... OK Senator. You have 30 seconds and then we'll pass to another. Thirty more seconds and then we'll move to another... Thank you. Thank you Senator Sanders. We're going to move on to the next question. You have 30 seconds Senator. We're going to move on to the secretary. Yes. Just a few seconds. OK. We're going to move on. OK next question. I want to continue with the issue of trust. Secretary Clinton on the night of the attacks in Benghazi you sent an e-mail to your daughter Chelsea... ...saying that Al Qaida was responsible for the killing of the Americans. However some of the families claim that you lied to them. To that speed the mother of the information officer Chaznea. Let's listen. Secretary Clinton did you lie to them? But Secretary Clinton what they're saying is that what the families are saying is that you told your daughter Chelsea one thing and a different thing to them. Thank you senator. Thank you. You have 30 seconds Senator. Thank you Senator. We're going to we're going to take a break. Go ahead. We have a question on education. Senator I'll continue with you. You propose free college tuition. So under your plan potentially millions of students who can not truly afford college would be getting federal subsidies. Is that right? Because my question was if you think for instance if Donald Trump's grandchildren or I'm sorry Hillary Clinton's grandchildren should they be able to go for free? For free. We'll continue this we'll continue talking about education. For that we go Enrique Cevedo has a question. Enrique Cevido. Thank you senator. Thank you very much. Thank you senator. Secretary thank you very much. Senator Sanders? Absolutely. This is your debate. We're going to take a break. And when we come back we'll talk about Latin America. Let's talk about Latin America. Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders it will be my welcome to Miami question. So it goes as follows. President Barack Obama is going to Cuba in two weeks. Forty percent of Cuban Americans supporting to uphold oppose a new White House policy towards Cuba.If you were president would you meet with the dissidents in Cuba? Would you meet with Fidel Castro? And would you consider Raul Castro a president or a dictator? Welcome to Miami. On Facebook by the way this is the conversation that everybody is having talking about Cuba. Senator Sanders. Secretary I have a question on Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is bankrupt. It owes more than $70 billion it cannot pay and we have a question from Facebook. Lian Purvea is asking you the following; I would like to know if during the first 100 days of your presidency you will help Puerto Rico restructure its public debt and help its economy. The first 100 days secretary. Senator Sanders your closing remarks.
2016-03-09 00:00:00,salinas  , This will be the first and only debate the candidates will do taking into account the millions of voters Univision News together with the Washington Post.

Good evening.
2016-03-09 00:00:00,unknown, We'll continue with the debate now.Senator Sanders you call your opponent Hillary Clinton an establishment politician. You yourself are a career politician. Why should voters prefer a career politicians over an establishment politician? Secretary Clinton she said she wants to go to grad school and get a PhD. What are you going to do to help her achieve that goal and pay off her student debt? Karen let's go back to you. When we come back we'll talk about Latin America. Don't leave. Of course you can follow us on Facebook live. Don't forget.
2016-03-09 00:00:00,unknown   first democratic debate focusing in hispanic topics i have   that supported, Good evening good evening.We heard a lot about immigration about the deportations and race. In your opinion who better and who presented the immigration proposal?
2016-03-09 00:00:00,tumulty, Secretary Clinton you have known Donald Trump a long time. You have seen what kind of campaign he's running. Secretary Clinton is Donald Trump a racist? Secretary Clinton my question was about his character. And that is one of the primary things that Americans think about when they choose their next president. How would you describe the character of a person who has said the sorts of things he has about Mexican immigrants about women and who would ban people from entering this country based on their religion? Senator Sanders do you think it's fair to call Donald Trump a racist? So what does that tell you about his character? Your time is up senator. Thank you. Thank you Enrique. Secretary Clinton a Washington Post poll just yesterday found that only 37 percent of Americans consider you honest and trustworthy. Now when you've been asked about this in the past you have said that this is the result of many many years of Republican attacks upon you. But Americans have also had 25 more than that years to get to know you for themselves.Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust? Thank you. Thank you. Senator Sanders you have demanded that Secretary Clinton release the transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches. Why is this important? Do you have reason to believe that she says one thing in private and another in public? So does this mean that you would not think she should have to disclose... But my question was do you think she saying one thing in the speeches and another in public? Thank you your time is up. Thank you Secretary Clinton. Thank you Senator. I'm going to call time here because I want to move on to a subject that more than two dozen Florida mayors have asked to raise with you. They have asked us to share with you their concern over the effects of rising sea levels and climate change in their communities. Just take a look at this map. You can see that no state has more at stake than Florida does. And no city has more at stake than Miami the city in which we are sitting. But many Republicans argue that this is not a man-made problem.Senator Sanders is it possible to move forward on this issue if you do not get a bipartisan consensus and what would you do? So you've just described the problem but how would you move forward given that this is the situation? Secretary Clinton can we do this without a bipartisan consensus? No major environmental legislation has ever passed without bipartisan votes. Secretary Clinton Senator Elizabeth Warren Senator Elizabeth Warren says personnel is policy. And she says that there is a revolving door between Wall Street and the highest levels of economic policy-making and regulation in Washington. Three of the last four Treasury secretaries appointed by Democratic presidents had ties to Citigroup. Do you agree with Elizabeth Warren's criticism that both your
